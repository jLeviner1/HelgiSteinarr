* Since Mark's age 2 years ago was half of Jan's age 2 years ago plus 5, we can set up the equation: Mark's age 2 years ago = 1/2 * Jan's age 2 years ago + 5
* Jan is currently 30 years old, so her age 2 years ago was 30 - 2 = 28. 
* Plugging this into the equation above, we get: Mark's age 2 years ago = 1/2 * 28 + 5

[EXP] 83: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 37, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

First, the food truck's initial cost is $3. 00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they'll need 10/10 = 1 loaf.  So the cost of bread is $3. 00. 

Next, they spend $30. 00 on different cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches, which is the same batch they're selling. 

Total cost so far: $3. 00 (bread) + $30. 00 (cheeses and condiments) = $33. 00

They sell 10 sandwiches for $7. 00 each, so total revenue is 10 x $7. 00 = $70. 00

Finally, let's calculate the net profit: Revenue - Total Cost = Net Profit
$70. 00 - $33. 00 = $37. 00

The answer is $37. 00.

A third of the movies are the ones that are in series.  So, we need to find one-third of the 600 movies.  To find one-third of 600, we can divide 600 by 3:

600/3 = 200

So, there are 200 movies that are in series.  Since Mike can get these for $6 each (a third of what the cost of a normal movie), we can calculate the total cost of these movies:

200 movies * $6 each = $1200

The remaining movies are those that are not part of a series.  To find the number of remaining movies, we subtract the number of series movies from the total number of movies:

600 - 200 = 400

These remaining movies are 40% older movies, which cost only $5 each.  To find the number of older movies, we can multiply the number of remaining movies by 40%:

400 movies * 40% = 400 movies * 0. 4 = 160

The cost of these older movies is:

160 movies * $5 each = $800

The remaining movies are not in a series and are not older movies.  They are normal movies that cost $10 each.  The number of these movies is:

400 movies - 160 movies = 240 movies

The cost of these normal movies is:

240 movies * $10 each = $2400

To find the total cost of replacing the movies, we add the cost of the series movies, older movies, and the remaining normal movies:

$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The answer is $4400.

[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let Paul's age be P and John's age be J. 
We know that Paul is 10 years older than John, so P = J + 10. 
We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age is P + J. 
The combined age of Peter, Paul and John is 100 years old, so we can set up the equation:
P + J + P = 100
Or, using the expression we found for P:
J + J + 10 + J = 100
Combine like terms:
3J + 10 = 100
Subtract 10 from both sides:
3J = 90
Divide by 3:
J = 30
So John is 30 years old.  Paul is 10 years older than John, so Paul is 30 + 10 = 40 years old.  We can find Peter's age by adding John's age and Paul's age:
Peter's age = P + J
= 40 + 30
= 70
The answer is 70.

The custodian has 80 classrooms to clean in 5 days.  To find the number of classrooms they need to clean each day, we can divide 80 by 5:

80 classrooms ÷ 5 days = 16 classrooms per day

It takes them 15 minutes per classroom, so the total time spent cleaning each day is:

16 classrooms × 15 minutes per classroom = 240 minutes per day

Since they work 8 hours a day, we need to convert the total time spent cleaning each day from minutes to hours:

240 minutes ÷ 60 (minutes per hour) = 4 hours per day

Now, let's find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms:

Time spent cleaning ÷ total time worked = percentage of day spent cleaning

4 hours cleaning ÷ 8 hours worked = 0. 5 or 50%

So, on average, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms.

[EXP] 183: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 38, [output]:  Let's start by determining the cost of the tickets.  There are two adults and one child.  Two adult tickets will cost 2 x $12 = $24, and one child ticket will cost $8.  The total cost of the tickets is $24 + $8 = $32. 

Then, they buy 2 popcorns for $3 each.  2 x $3 = $6. 

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns.  $32 + $6 = $38. 

The answer is 38.

[EXP] 186: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Ryan got 6 dollars each week.  For 3 weeks, he got 6 * 3 = 18 dollars.  Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends.  The ice cream cones cost 1. 25 each.  For 4 cones, that would be 4 * 1. 25 = 5 dollars.  Ryan spent 5 dollars on ice cream.  He would have 18 - 5 = 13 dollars left.  To buy movies tickets, they cost 6. 50 each.  To find how many Ryan can buy, we do 13 / 6. 50 = 2.  So Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

[EXP] 188: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2280, [output]:  Let's first start by finding how much money Kim raises.  Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430.  So Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750. 

 Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300.  So Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700. 

To find the total amount of money the girls raised, we add up the amount raised by each girl:

$430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $300 (Sarah) + $700 (Maryam) = $2180

The answer is $2180.

[EXP] 189: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 230, [output]: 80% off 400 dollars means he got 400 - (80% of 400).  To find 80% of 400, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by moving the decimal two places to the left (80/100 = 0. 8), then multiply 0. 8 by 400, which is 320.  So the radiator costs 400 - 320 = 80 dollars.  Then, he hires a mechanic who charges 50 dollars per hour for 3 hours.  So the mechanic charges 50 * 3 = 150 dollars.  In total, he pays 80 + 150 = 230 dollars.  The answer is 230.
