[EXP] 1: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Janet starts with 16 eggs.  She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.  Then, she bakes muffins with 4 more, so 13 - 4 = 9 eggs are left.  She sells these eggs for $2 each, so she makes 9 * 2 = 18 dollars at the farmers' market.  The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 2: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 160, [output]: 2 GB/minute is the rate at which Carla can download the file.  To find out how many minutes it would normally take to download the file, we can divide the size of the file by the downloading rate: 200 GB / (2 GB/minute) = 100 minutes.  However, Windows forces a restart at 40% of the way through the download. 40% of 200 GB is 80 GB, so the file is 80 GB complete at that point.  To find out how many minutes it took to download 80 GB, we can multiply 80 GB by (1 / 2 GB/minute), or divide by 2: 80 GB / (2 GB/minute) = 40 minutes.  Then, 100 - 40 = 60 minutes is left, which is the time left to download the remaining 120 GB.   This is 120 / (2 GB/minute) = 60 minutes.  Adding up the time it took to download 80 GB and 120 GB, we get 40 + 60 = 100 minutes.  Then, the computer was off for 20 minutes.   So the total time is 100 + 20 = 120 minutes.  The answer is 120 minutes. 
[EXP] 3: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]: 20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance, which means 20% of 20 students is: 0. 20 * 20 / 100 = 4 students. 

Now, we have 20 - 4 = 16 students remaining. 25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance, which means 25% of 16 students is: 0. 25 * 16 / 100 = 4 students. 

Now we have 16 - 4 = 12 students remaining. 12 students remaining and the entire class has 20 students, so the percentage of students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is: 0.  12 / 20 * 100 = 60%. 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
[EXP] 4: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Samantha is 31 years old.  Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.  Raymond had a son when he was 23.  So, it has been 25 - 23 = 2 years since Raymond's son was born.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 5: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]: 60 miles are the total distance.  He stopped after 20 miles. 15 miles before the end of the trip is at 60 - 15 = 45 miles.  So, he stopped at 20 and 45 miles.   Between those points, he traveled 45 - 20 = 25.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 6: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Mike started with 4 points in the first 20 minutes.  For the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than he scored in the first 20 minutes.  This means he scored 4 + 25% of 4 points.  25% of 4 is 4 / 4 x 1/4 = 1. 4 points + 1 point is 5 points.  So he scored 5 points in the second 20 minutes.   5 points for the second 20 minutes, plus the 4 points for the first 20 minutes, is 4 + 5 = 9.  He scored a total of 9 points.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 7: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]:  Originally, there were 5 pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces.  So, the total number of pie pieces is 5 x 8 = 40.  After the guests ate their pie, there were 14 pieces left.  So, the guests took 40 - 14 = 26 pieces of pie.  The answer is 26. 
[EXP] 8: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  First, find the total number of units in the building.  Since there are 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is 15 x 8 = 120.  Then, find out how many units are occupied.  3/4 of the building is occupied, so the number of occupied units is 3/4 x 120 = 90.  Now, find the number of unoccupied units.   We had 120 total units, and 90 are occupied, so the number of unoccupied units is 120 - 90 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 9: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Peter needs 7 dollars for the ticket and 7 dollars for the popcorn, so that's a total of 14 dollars for each movie.  If Peter has 42 dollars, he can go to the movies 42 / 14 = 3 times.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 10: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1596, [output]:  Aleena paid $140 per month.  For the first 6 months, she would pay 6 * 140 = 840 dollars.  For the next 6 months, she would pay 10% less.  10% of 140 is 140 * (10/100) = 14.  So the next 6 months would cost 6 * (140 - 14) = 6 * 126 = 756.  In total, she paid 840 + 756 = 1596 dollars.  The answer is 1596. 
[EXP] 11: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7425, [output]: 5 dance classes each day on weekdays means 5 x 5 = 25 classes on the weekdays. 8 classes on Saturday means 25 + 8 = 33 classes in total.  Each class has 15 students, so 33 classes * 15 students per class = 495 students.  Each student pays 15 dollars.   So to get the total amount of money, 495 students * 15 dollars per student = 7425 dollars.  The answer is 7425. 
[EXP] 12: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.  Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, Raymond does 400 รท 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.  David does 1/4 as much laundry as Sarah, so he does 400 รท 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.  To calculate the difference, 200 - 100, Raymond does 100 more pounds of laundry than David.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 13: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  There were 22 games played in total. 8 more games were won than lost.   If we let W be the number of won games and L be the number of lost games, we can set up the equation W + L = 22, and W = L + 8.  We can solve this by setting W = L + 8 in the first equation, getting (L + 8) + L = 22, which simplifies to 2L + 8 = 22.  Subtracting 8 from both sides gives 2L = 14, and then dividing both sides by 2 gives L = 7.  So the number of lost games is 7.  The number of won games is 8 more than that, so the number of won games is 7 + 8 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 14: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 28, [output]:  Firstly, since Cindy has 4 pets, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.  Since Jan has three times the pets as Marcia, Jan has 6 * 3 = 18 pets.  In total, the three have 4 + 6 + 18 pets.  4 + 6 + 18 is 28.  The answer is 28. 
[EXP] 15: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 30 cars were originally on the motorway. 5 cars took an exit, so the remaining cars that went through the traffic jam are 30 - 5 = 25 cars.  These 25 cars are the sum of the cars that went through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that went through in the remaining 15 minutes.  The cars that went through in the remaining 15 minutes are 20, as stated in the problem.  So the cars that went through in the first 15 minutes are 25 - 20 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 16: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Amir eats 5 cookies.  If Cody eats three times as many as Amir, then Cody eats 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.  If they eat both together, they eat 5 + 15 = 20 cookies.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 17: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]: 4 teachers, each teaching 2 times, makes a total of 4 * 2 = 8 times the whiteboard is used each day.  For each use, it is cleaned 3 times.  So the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned is 8 * 3 = 24.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 18: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 95200, [output]: 30% higher means that Adrien's salary was 1. 3 times Lylah's salary. 30% higher is 130% of Lylah's salary, and 130% is $\frac{130}{100}$ times Lylah's salary.  So we can say that Adrien's salary is $\frac{130}{100}L$, where $L$ is Lylah's salary.  Since Adrien made $40000$ four years ago, his salary then was $\frac{130}{100}L$.  Since Adrien made 40% more than his salary four years ago, his salary now is $\frac{140}{100} (\frac{130}{100}L) = \frac{182}{100}L$. 

Lylah's salary was $\frac{1}{1. 3}$ times Adrien's salary four years ago.   Since Adrien made $\frac{130}{100}L$ four years ago, Lylah's salary was $\frac{1}{1. 3} (\frac{130}{100}L) = \frac{100}{130} (\frac{130}{100}L) = \frac{100}{130}L = \frac{10}{13}L$.  Four years later, Lylah's salary was $\frac{1}{1. 13} (\frac{10}{13}L) = \frac{10}{13}L \times (1. 13) = \frac{13}{13}L = L$.  So four years later, Lylah's salary is L.  

Add their salaries together:
$$\frac{182}{100}L + L$$
$$=\frac{182}{100}L + \frac{100}{100}L$$
$$=\frac{182+100}{100}L=\frac{282}{100}L$$

We know that $40000 = \frac{130}{100}L$.  Multiply both sides by 100 to get $400000 = 130L$.  Then, divide both sides by 130 to solve for L: $L = \frac{400000}{130} = \frac{100000}{32. 5}$.   Substitute this value for L into the equation last calculated:

$$\frac{282}{100}\cdot \frac{100000}{32. 5}$$
$$=\frac{2820000}{3250}$$
$$= \boxed{868. }$$.  The answer is $868. 
[EXP] 19: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 82, [output]:  Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages means he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages. 38 chicken sausages plus 44 fish sausages is 82.  The answer is 82. 
[EXP] 20: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.  On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 6 x 4 = 24 miles on Tuesday.  If his total mileage Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles, that means he walked 41 - (4 + 24) miles on Wednesday. 4 + 24 = 28. 41 - 28 is 13.  The answer is 13. 
[EXP] 21: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 20 cars are available for rent. 12 are automatic cars and 4 are manual cars. 12 + 4 = 16 cars. 20 - 16 = 4 are semi-automatic.  To find the percentage, we can use the formula: (4 / 20) * 100%. 4 / 20 is 0. 0 * 100 is 0%.  So, 4 cars (or 20%) are semi-automatic.  The answer is 20%. 
[EXP] 22: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 75, [output]: 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.  In the next 6 hours, 1/2 that many bees (1/2 of 30) return, which is 15.  Then, 2 times as many bees as the first group (2 times 30 = 60) leave the hive and don't come back, yet.  Then, all bees that left the hive previously and didn't return will return. 30 bees were in the hive and didn't return.  They all return now, which is an additional 30 bees.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 23: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 272, [output]:  On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes each day, with 1-hour classes.  This is 3 classes * 1 hour/ class * 3 days = 9 hours. 
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day, with 2-hour classes.  This is 2 classes * 2 hours/class * 2 days = 8 hours.  So Kimo has 9 hours on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and 8 hours on Tuesday and Thursday, each week.  That's 17 hours per week.  Since there are 16 weeks of school, Kimo has attended classes for 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours.  The answer is 272. 
[EXP] 24: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]:  Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.  Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.  He caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.  Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.  Locsin caught a total of 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.   In total, Anakin and Locsin caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 25: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Ethel has 8 dollars. 2 times Ethel's money is 8 x 2 = 16.  Jimmy has 2 dollars more than that, so Jimmy has 16 + 2 = 18.  The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 26: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Juan and his brother Carlos sell each glass for $0. 50 and get 20 glasses per gallon.  So, their revenue per gallon is 20 *$0. 50 = $10. 

It costs them $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar per gallon.  So, the total cost of one gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.  If they sell each gallon for $10, their profit per gallon is $10 - $5 = $5.  They made a profit of $25 in total.  To find out how many gallons they made, we divide $25 by their profit per gallon, $5.  $25/5 = 5 gallons.  So, the cost of lemons for 5 gallons is 5 * $3 = $15.   The answer is $15. 
[EXP] 27: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 23, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

Jan's current age is 30.  Two years ago, she was 30 - 2 = 28. 

We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.  So 5 years older than half of Jan's age means 5 years older than half of 28.  Half of 28 is 14.  So mark was 14 + 5 = 19 two years ago.  That means that Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21.  

Jean is two years older than Mark.  So Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23.  The answer is 23. 
[EXP] 28: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 34, [output]: 3 friends spent $20. 25 on 3 tickets to the fair.  So the cost of each ticket is $6. 75.  Let's call the cost of food 'x'.  We know they spent $4. 50 less on food than on tickets.  So x = $6. 75 - $4.  50.  x = $2.  25.  So they spent $2.  25 on food.   They also went on 2 rides, each of which cost $33.  So total cost for the rides is 2 x $33 = $66.  Total cost is the sum of the costs of tickets, food, and rides.  That is ($20.   25) + ($2.  25) + ($66) = $89.  Total money spent by the three friends is divided by 3 because it was split evenly.  So each friend paid $89  divided by 3.  We can calculate this on a calculator.   $89  divided by 3 = $29.  67. 
[EXP] 29: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]: 200 pounds of carrots are to be distributed to 40 restaurants.  Each restaurant gets 2 pounds.  40 * 2 = 80 pounds.  200 - 80 pounds will be left unused. 200 - 80 is 120.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 30: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 31, [output]:  Carl ate 2 slices of cheese per sandwich for lunch every day of the week.  There are 7 days in a week.  7 days * 2 slices per day = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.  He ate 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than per sandwich, so 3 omelets made this week * (2 + 1) slices per omelet = 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for omelets.  In total, he used 14 + 9 = 23 slices for lunch and omelets.   And he used 8 slices of cheese in the macaroni and cheese.  23 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.   The answer is 31. 
[EXP] 31: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Sara wants to buy a $30 jacket, and 2 * $20 = $40 shoes, so she needs 30 + 40 = 70 dollars in total.  She already has 10 dollars.  Before babysitting, she needs 70 - 10 = 60 dollars more.  Every time she babysits, she earns 5 dollars.   So she needs 60 / 5 = 12 times to earn 60 dollars.  But, she can also earn 4 dollars per time she mows the lawn.   So, she can earn the 60 dollars either by babysitting 12 times or by mowing the lawn 60 / 4 = 15 times.  Since 4 is less than 5, she must mow the lawn at least 15 times to have enough money to afford the jacket and shoes.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 32: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  There are originally 4 roses in the vase.  There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.  So there are 4 roses and 11 dahlias in total.  4 + 11 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 33: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 180, [output]:  Carlos rents a canoe for 30 dollars an hour.  He uses it for 3 hours, so the cost is 3 x 30 = 90.  Benji rents a banana boat raft for 18 dollars an hour.   He uses it for 5 hours, so the cost is 5 x 18 = 90.  The total cost is 90 + 90 = 180.  The answer is 180. 
[EXP] 34: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells and Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells.

[EXP] 35: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 68, [output]:  The problem says Jessa is 20 years old.  Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.  Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.   To find the sum of their ages, add them all together.  20 + 25 + 23 = 68.  The answer is 68. 
[EXP] 36: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Let's start by finding the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums.  There are 32 - 4 = 28 snails more in the second aquarium.  The problem says this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.   So, we can let x be the number of fish in each aquarium.  Then, 2x = 28.  To solve for x, divide both sides by 2, and we get x = 14.  So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 37: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 73, [output]:  Last night Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.  Total, he killed 10 + 15 = 25 animals.  Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, so if cougars are x, wolves are 3x.  He killed 3 fewer cougars than the previous night, which means the number of cougars today is 15 - 3 = 12.  So x is 12, and the number of wolves is 3x = 36.   The total number of animals he killed today is 36 + 12 = 48.  So, in total, Rick killed 25 + 48 = 73 animals.  The answer is 73. 
[EXP] 38: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 168, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Andrea has 52 apples and 8 more apples than Jamal.  This means that Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples. 

The problem also states that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.  Therefore, Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.  Since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, Andrea has 48 รท 2 = 24 bananas. 

To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of apples and bananas for each person: Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, for a total of 52 + 24 = 76.  Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, for a total of 44 + 48 = 92. 

Finally, we can add the total number of fruits for both Andrea and Jamal: 76 + 92 = 168.  The answer is 168. 
[EXP] 39: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 118000, [output]: 3% of the selling price of $400 000 is 0. 03 x 400000 = 12000. 5% of the selling price is 0. 05 x 400000 = 20000.  The transfer fees and brokerage fees total 12000 + 20000 = 32000.  Mr.  Tan had to pay $250 000 for the remaining loan amount.  So, the total amount he paid is 32000 + 250000 = 328000.   Mr.  Tan had to pay a total of $328000 out of the $400000.   To find the net proceeds, subtract the amount Mr.  Tan paid from the selling price: 400000 - 328000 = 72000.  So, the net proceeds from selling the house is $72,000.  The answer is 72000. 
[EXP] 40: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 315, [output]: 1st, we will find out how many stitches the collar takes.  The collar takes a tenth of the body, which takes 900 stitches, so it takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches. 2nd, we find out how many stitches the rosette takes.  It takes twice as many as the collar, which takes 90 stitches, so it takes 90 x 2 = 180 stitches. 3rd, the sum of the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170.  The sum given is 1800, so 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches are left for the 2 sleeves.  Since there are 2 sleeves, each sleeve will take 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.  The answer is 315. 
[EXP] 41: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Peter bought 20 popsicles at 0. 25 each. 0. 25 * 20 = 5.  So he spent 5 dollars on popsicles.  He also bought 4 ice cream bars at 0.  50 each. 0.  50 * 4 = 2.  So he spent 2 dollars on ice cream bars.  To find the total, add the 5 and the 2: 5 + 2 = 7.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 42: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 76-star flag has 3 rows of 8 stars, so 3 * 8 = 24 stars.  Then it has 2 rows of 6 stars, so 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 76 - 24 - 12 is 40 stars left.  40 / 5 = 8.  There are 8 rows of 5-star rows altogether on the flag.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 43: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Will buys 15 oranges.  The oldest son is 8 years old and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.  Since the youngest son washes 4 oranges and the oldest son washes 8 oranges, 4 + 8 = 12 oranges were washed.   To find how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of washed oranges from the original 15 oranges: 15 - 12 = 3.  The answer is 3.

In total, 12 + 12 = 24 people are invited. 8 people couldn't come due to illness, so there are 24 - 8 = 16 people left. 1/4 of 8 is 2 people, so 2 more people had previous commitments. 16 - 2 = 14.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 47: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Jam has 26 pencils in total, which includes 2 loose pencils.  So, the number of pencils in the 3 boxes is 26 - 2 = 24.  Since each box has the same number of pencils, we can divide 24 by 3 to find that each box has 8 pencils.   Meg has 46 pencils in total.  They need to store 24 + 46 pencils in total.    So, 24 + 46 is 70 pencils.  Since each box has 8 pencils, they need to buy at least 70 / 8 = 9 boxes to store all their pencils.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 48: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Erin started with 7 lollipops.  Her mother gave her another 10, so she had 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.  If she gave 3 to Ella, then she would have 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 49: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 72, [output]: 8 shares at 8 dollars each will be 8 * 8 = 64 dollars.  The first year, the stock price increases 50%. 50% of 8 is 4. 4 dollars more will make it 8 + 4 = 12 dollars. 12 dollars is the new price per share.  So Maria's 8 shares are now 12 * 8 = 96 dollars.  Then in the second year, the stock price goes down 25%. 25% of 12 is 3. 3 dollars less will make it 12 - 3 = 9 dollars. 9 dollars is the new price per share.  So the final value of all Maria's shares is 9 * 8 = 72 dollars.  The answer is 72. 
[EXP] 50: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 180000, [output]: 5000 meters is the distance Tyson runs in a day. 1/5 more meters means adding 1/5 * 5000 = 1000 meters to the daily run. 1000 + 5000 = 6000, so he runs 6000 meters per day now. 6000 * 30 is 180,000, so he will run a total of 180,000 meters in a month. 180,000 m.  The answer is 180,000. 
[EXP] 51: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Peyton started with a 1 hour yoga class on Monday.  Then there was a cooking class on Tuesday that lasted 3 times as long as the yoga class. 1 * 3 = 3, so the cooking class took 3 hours.   Then there was a half-hour cheese-tasting event on Wednesday. 3 hours completed by Tuesday. 1 hour yoga + 3 hours cooking = 4 hours by Tuesday.  Half-hour event on Wednesday. 4. 5 hours to date.  Then there was a museum tour on Thursday that took half as long as the cooking class.  The cooking class took 3 hours, so the museum tour took half of that, 3 / 2 = 1. 5 hours to date + 1 hour for museum tour = 6 hours.  Then there were 2 hours of errands on Friday. 6 hours to date + 2 hours errands = 8 hours.  Peyton has 8 hours of after-work activities scheduled.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 52: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Morgan's dad said she had $90 budgeted.  She wants to play one round of mini-golf for $5, have $5 for arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts 2 times at $10 each.  $5 + 5 + 2 x 10 = $30.  She will use $30 for these activities, so subtract 30 from 90.   90 - 30 = 60.  The amount left, 60, is how much she can use to pay for food or other activities with her friends.  60 / 5 = 12.  She can invite 12 friends.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 53: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 49, [output]: 96 fourth-graders are in the school. 43 of them are girls.  So there must be 96 - 43 = 53 boys. 4 fourth-grade boys were absent, and we are left with the number of boys at school on Friday.  So the total number of boys at school on Friday is 53 - 4 = 49.  The answer is 49. 
[EXP] 54: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  On friday, they sold 14 pairs of shoes.  Then on saturday, they sold double that number, so 2 x 14 = 28 pairs.  So in total, they had sold 14 + 28 = 42 pairs.   On sunday, they sold one-half that number, which is 28/2 = 14 pairs.  This is 42 + 14 = 56 pairs.  However, 6 pairs were returned.   So the final total is 56 - 6 = 50 pairs.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 55: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 10 pairs of socks are 20 socks. 15 loose socks. 20 + 15 = 35 socks were washed.  There are 50 socks in total. 50 - 35 = 15 socks are missing.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 56: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]: 52 members, 50% are boys, 50% are girls.  That means, 26 are boys and 26 are girls.  If only the girls perform, 26 will perform.   Half can't make it, which means 13 can't make it and 13 girls can make it to the show.  With the 3 teachers joining in, the total number of people performing is 13 + 3 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 57: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]:  There was a cable package costing $60.  Netflix is $10 alone. 2 additional services (Hulu and Disney Plus) are $10 each, but with a 20% discount for bundling, that will be $10 * 0. 8  = $8 each.  So, they cost 2 * 8 = $16 together.   The total cost of the streaming services is $10 + $16 = $26.  He saves 60 - 26 = $34.   The answer is $34. 
[EXP] 58: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Beth is 5 years older than Erica.  Erica is 30 years old, so Beth is 5 + 30 = 35 years old.  Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old.   The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 59: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 200, [output]:  Allan has twice as many corn as cannolis.  There are 40 cannolis.  So he has 2 x 40 = 80 corns.   Before buying cobs and nuts, he had a total of 40 + 80 = 120 units.  He buys more!  He bought 60 cannolis, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.   He bought 40 fewer corns, so he now has 80 - 40 = 40 corns.  In total, he has 100 cannolis + 40 corns = 140 units.   The answer is 140. 
[EXP] 60: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 25, [output]: 0. 

Let's break it down step by step:

* 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 is (5/100) x 50,000 = 2,500 candles.  These candles will smell like wet dog.  They may or may not explode. 

* Marcy guarantees that 99% of her candles will not explode.  This means that 1% of her candles will explode. 1% of 50,000 is (1/100) ร 50,000 = 500 candles will explode.  These candles may or may not smell like wet dog.  

* To find the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog, we need to find the overlap between the two groups.  2,500 candles will smell like wet dog, and 500 candles will explode.   Some of these candles will meet both conditions, but we need to add these two numbers to get the total number of candles that meet either condition: 2,500 + 500 = 3,000.  However, we are looking for candles that meet BOTH conditions (explode and smell like wet dog), not either.   The number of candles that meet the "and" condition is the intersection of the circles in a Venn diagram.  Since there is no overlap in these two conditions, the number of candles that explode and smell like wet dog is 0.  The answer is 0. 
[EXP] 61: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 17000, [output]:  Mr.  Josue started with 5000 dollars.  The first bank gave him 4000 dollars.  The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so 4000 x 2 = 8000.  So Mr.  Josue received 4000 + 8000 = 12000 dollars from the two banks.  5000 + 12000 = 16000.  So he has 16000 dollars now.  The answer is 16000. 
[EXP] 62: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 150, [output]:  Kenny has 50 dollars in spending cash.  He wants to buy a 100-dollar ticket, so he needs 100 - 50 = 50 more dollars.  We know that he makes 1. 5 dollars for each card he sells.  Let's call the number of cards he started with 'x'.  He keeps 1/3 of them.  So, the number of cards he keeps is 1/3x.   That leaves the number of cards he sells equal to x - 1/3x = 2/3x.  Since he got 50 dollars from selling these cards, you can set up the equation: 

1. 5 * 2/3x = 50.  From here, we can solve for x.   First, multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the denominator: 

1. 5 * 2x = 150.  Divide both sides by 5: 

2.  2x = 30.  Finally, divide both sides by 2: 

3.  x = 15.  

Since x represents the number of cards he started with, and he keeps 1/3 of them, he keeps 1/3 * 15 = 5 cards and sells the rest.  The number of cards he sells is 15 - 5 = 10.   The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 63: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 40 cents for a bag of chips. 75 cents for a candy bar.  George has $5. 3 bags of chips = 40 x 3 = 120 cents = 1. 20 dollar. 1% of $5 is 0. 05 dollars.  So he had 5 - 0. 05 = 4.  95 dollars left after buying 3 bags of chips.  And the 4. 95 dollars should be 495 cents.  He must have spent 5 * 100 = 500 cents in total. 100 cents to buy each dollar.   He spent 500 - 120 = 380 cents on candy bars.  75 cents to buy each bar, so he bought 380 / 75 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 64: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Let's find out how many beads Elizabeth and Margareth bought respectively.  Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads.  That's 1 + 2 = 3 packs of beads.  Each pack has 20 beads, so Elizabeth bought 3 x 20 = 60 beads in total.   Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads.  That's 3 + 4 = 7 packs of beads.   Each pack has 20 beads, so Margareth bought 7 x 20 = 140 beads in total.  Now let's find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth.  Margareth has 140 - 60 = 80 more beads than Elizabeth.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 65: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 539, [output]:  The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for 576 dollars.  After selling 17 sneakers for 20 dollars each, he got 17 * 20 = 340. 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers are left.  31 sneakers were sold to a department store for 25 dollars each, so he made 25 * 31 = 775 dollars.  In total, he made 340 + 775 = 1115 dollars.  He spent 576 dollars, so his profit is 1115 - 576 = 539.  The answer is 539. 
[EXP] 66: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1920, [output]: 1 bed is 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.  There are 10 beds, so that is 10 * 32 = 320 cubic feet. 320/2 = 160 bags of soil. 160 bags * 12 dollars each is 1920.  The answer is 1920. 
[EXP] 67: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 71, [output]:  Ali started with 21 dollars.  If Leila gave him half of her 100 dollars, then Leila gave him 100 / 2 = 50 dollars.  So Ali now has 21 + 50 = 71 dollars.  The answer is 71. 
[EXP] 68: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles.  Each jar can be used to decorate 8 cupcakes.  That means the 6 jars can be used to decorate 8 * 6 = 48 cupcakes.  Each pan can hold 12 cupcakes, so to use up all the cupcakes, Mary must bake 48/12 pans worth of cupcakes.   48 divided by 12 is 4, with a remainder of 0.  So the answer is 4 pans worth of cupcakes. 
[EXP] 69: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Sarah spent a total of $300. 300 / 15 = 20. 20 books were bought in total.  She gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids.   20 / 4 = 5.  The answer is 5 books each child got. 
[EXP] 70: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel.  Since Gabriel has 20 songs, Luri has 3 x 20 = 60 songs.  Since each player can store up to 100 songs, Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs, and Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs.  To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, subtract 40 from 80. 80 - 40 is 40.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 71: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  The child already has 4 dollars. 12 - 4 is 8, so he needs to save 8 more dollars.  He promises to save 2 dollars a day. 8 / 2 = 4.  So it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining 8 dollars.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 72: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 112, [output]:  Paul drove his car twice a day for 14 days, so that's 14 x 2 = 28 rides. 14 rides in the morning cost 6 dollars each, so that's 14 x 6 = 84. 14 afternoon rides cost 2 dollars each, so that's 14 x 2 = 28. 84 + 28 = 112.  The answer is 112. 
[EXP] 73: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Suzie bought four packs of gum.  She bought 2 packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry.  She also bought 1 pack of grape gum and 1 pack of green apple gum. 

Let's start with the total money she paid: $7.  She paid $2 for grape gum.   She paid half of $2 for green apple gum, which is $1.  That's $3 total for grape and green apple gum.  That leaves $7 - $3 = $4 for the two packs of strawberry gum.  Since there are two packs, $4 divided by 2 is $2.  Each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 74: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 110, [output]:  Gerald works 7 days a week and gets paid 30 dollars every day. 7 x 30 = 210.  He spent 100 dollars. 210 - 100 = 110.  The answer is 110. 
[EXP] 75: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]:  Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 x 10 = 40 dollars.  He also has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 x 20 = 120 dollars.  In total, he has 40 + 120 = 160 dollars.   Then, he gives his sister half of this amount.  Half of 160 is 160 / 2 = 80 dollars.  After giving his sister 80 dollars, he is left with 160 - 80 = 80 dollars.  Finally, he uses 3/5 of this 80 dollars to buy dinner.   3/5 of 80 is 3/5 x 80 = 48 dollars.  So he has 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left after dinner.   The answer is 32.

The answer is 36. 
[EXP] 77: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Jame will be 27 in 5 years.  So his current age is 27 - 5 = 22.  His age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30. 

His cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age in 8 years.  Twice Jame's age in 8 years is 30 x 2 = 60.  5 years younger than that is 60 - 5 = 55.  So his cousin's age in 8 years is 55.  His current age is 55 - 8 = 47.  So the difference in their ages now is 47 - 22 = 25.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 78: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 35, [output]: 50 dollars for dinner plus an additional 20% tip means we need to add 20% of 50 to the original bill. 20% of 50 is (20/100) x 50 = 10. 50 + 10 = 60. 60 is how much the meal with the tip costs.  Because my wife and I need to split it evenly, that means we will each pay 60/2 = 30 dollars.  So the answer is 30. 
[EXP] 79: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 130, [output]:  Elise starts with writing the alphabet which has 26 letters. 2 times she writes the full alphabet, so 2 x 26 = 52.  Then she writes half of the alphabet which is 26 / 2 = 13.  So she writes 13 more letters. 52 + 13 = 65.  Then she re-writes everything she has already written.  This is an additional 65 letters. 65 + 65 = 130.   The answer is 130. 
[EXP] 80: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 92, [output]:  Bill started with 2 cases of water, which have 24 bottles each. 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.  He needs 2 bottles per guest, and he has 70 guests. 70 x 2 = 140 bottles.  He already has 48 bottles. 140 - 48 = 92.  So he needs 92 additional bottles.  The answer is 92. 
[EXP] 81: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]: 3 cages have 10 hamsters, so 3 x 10 = 30 hamsters. 3 cages have 5 guinea pigs, so 3 x 5 = 15 guinea pigs.  Hamsters + guinea pigs = 30 + 15 = 45 rodents.  The answer is 45. 
[EXP] 82: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Let's break down the problem:

1.  The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.  For each of the next 3 teeth, she gave Sharon $1  each, so she gave a total of $3 for those teeth. 

So far, Sharon has $5 + $3 = $8.  For each of the last 2 teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth that she had received for each of the previous three teeth.   We know that the tooth fairy gave $1 for each of the previous three teeth, so half of that is $0. 5.   Thus, she received $0. 5  for each of the last two teeth, and a total of $1  for both teeth, which is $1.  Adding that to the total, Sharon had $8 + $1 = $9.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 83: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 37, [output]:  First, let's find the cost per sandwich.  To make 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread, which costs $3.  They also need $30 worth of cheese and condiments, which is  $30 / 10 sandwiches = $3 per sandwich.  So the total cost per sandwich is $3 (for bread) + $3 (for cheese and condiments) = $6.  Then, let's find their total revenue.   They sell 10 sandwiches for $7 each, so their total revenue is 10 x $7 = $70.  Now, let's find their net profit.   Their total cost per sandwich is $6, and they sell 10 sandwiches, so their total cost is 10 x $6 = $60.  Their total revenue is $70.  To find their net profit, subtract their total cost from their total revenue.   $70 - $60 = $10.  The answer is $10. 
[EXP] 84: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 215, [output]:  First, we must convert the time for each movie to minutes.  The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, which is equal to 1 * 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.  The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long, which is equal to 2 * 60 + 5 = 125 minutes. 

Then we can add the time for both movies.  90 + 125 = 215.  The answer is 215. 
[EXP] 85: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 52, [output]: 47 is the starting typing speed. 52 is the next measurement.  A 5 word increase means the last measurement will be 52 + 5 = 57.  To find the average, add 47, 52, and 57.  47 + 52 + 57 = 156.   Take the sum and divide by the number of measurements.  The number of measurements is 3.  156 divided by 3 is 52.  The answer is 52. 
[EXP] 86: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Let Jerry's current age be x. 

We are told that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. 5 years ago Jerry was x - 5 years old.  Now he is twice that or 2(x - 5) years old.  This is equal to his current age x.  So:

2(x - 5) = x

We are going to solve for x.  First, let's distribute the 2 on the left:

2x - 10 = x

Next, let's isolate the x term by adding 10 to both sides:

2x = x + 10

Then, let's subtract x from both sides:

x = 10

So Jerry's current age is 10.  If Jerry is 10 years old now, then he will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old in 3 years.  The answer is 13. 
[EXP] 87: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 1. 1200 miles were traveled in 3 hours. 1200 / 3 = 400 miles per hour. 2. 2000 miles need to be traveled. 2000 / 400 = 5 hours.  The answer is 5.

The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 89: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step.  The beanstalk was originally 3 inches tall.   In the second week, it doubled in height, which means it became 3 x 2 = 6 inches tall.  Then, in the third week, it grew 4 more inches.  So, 6 + 4 = 10.  The beanstalk is 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 90: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Charmaine is currently unknown number of years old because the question doesn't give us that information.  But we know she will be 16 in 12 years.  So, let's find her current age.  Let's call her current age X.  In 12 years, she will be 16 years old, so we can set up the equation:

X + 12 = 16

We can solve for X:

X = 16 - 12
X = 4

So, Charmaine is currently 4 years old.  We want to find her age 4 years from now.  So, we add 4 to her current age:

4 + 4 = 8

The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 91: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 100 riders overall, and 25% of them can stay upright. 25% of 100 is 25, so 25 surfers can stay upright.

2.  His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old. 3.   Their son is currently half as old as his mom, which is 64 / 2 = 32 years old. 4.   Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, and their son is 32 years old, so their son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.  The answer is 29. 
[EXP] 94: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2100, [output]:  Let us calculate the sales of green hats in the first month.  If the sales of red hats are $400 and it is half of the total sales of green hats, then the total sales of green hats in the first month are 2 x 400 = 800.  To find the total amount she made in the first month, we add the sales of red and green hats, 400 + 800 = 1200. 

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.  We need to calculate 3/4 of 1200.  We divide 1200 by 4 and then multiply by 3, so (1200/4) * 3 = 900.  The total amount she made in the second month is 900.  To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the amount earned in the first month and the second month, 1200 + 900 = 2100.  The answer is 2100. 
[EXP] 95: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

Finley cooked the rice for 30 minutes.  It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork compared to rice.  So, rice took 30 minutes, and pork took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.  The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, which is (30 + 50) / 2 = 40 minutes.  Therefore, 30 minutes + 50 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes to cook all the food.  The answer is 120 minutes. 
[EXP] 96: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 360, [output]: 150 teachers are on the court. 60% are history teachers.  To find 60% of 150, convert to a decimal by moving the decimal to the left 2 places (because there are 2 digits after the 6 in 60%). 60% becomes 0. 6. 150 x 0. 6 = 90. 90 teachers are history teachers and the rest are math teachers. 150 - 90 = 60.  60 teachers are math teachers.  Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day.  So the total hours the math teachers sleep is 60 x 6 = 360.   The answer is 360. 
[EXP] 97: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Christina had 30 days.  The first 8 were good, the next 8 were bad, and the next 8 were neutral.  So this accounts for the first 24 days of the month.  After this, there are 6 days left.   The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.  So 3 out of the remaining days are good.   The other 3 are not good.  So the number of good days in the whole month is the 12 good days at the beginning plus the 3 good days at the end, which is 12 + 3 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 98: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 576, [output]: 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, so the ratio is 6:36. 96 potatoes is 16 times 6, so we can multiply both sides of the ratio by 16. 6 * 16 = 96, and 36 * 16 = 576. 96 potatoes make 576 hash browns.  The answer is 576. 
[EXP] 99: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Greta bakes 30 cookies.  Celinda bakes twice as many, so she bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.  Greta and Celinda bake 30 + 60 = 90 cookies in total.  They eat 10 of the cookies.  So the number of cookies in the box is 90 - 10 = 80.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 100: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 68, [output]:  Brittany's comforter has 14 red squares. 4 more blue squares than red squares means there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares. 6 more green squares than blue squares means there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.  Finally, 12 fewer white squares than green squares means there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.  In total, there are 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.  Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area is 68 square feet.  The answer is 68. 
[EXP] 101: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 135, [output]: 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each will be 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks in total. 

Hannah will see 40% of these fireworks. 40% of 300 is 40/100 * 300 = 120.  

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.  Adding these to the 120 fireworks she will see, Hannah will see 120 + 15 = 135 fireworks.  The answer is 135. 
[EXP] 102: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 40% of the river's water is used by Colorado City.  Of that 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes.  So 40% * 80% = 32% of the river's water is used by the city for industrial purposes.   Since 40% is used by the city and 32% is used by the city for industrial purposes, 40% - 32% = 8% of the river's water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.  The answer is 8%. 
[EXP] 103: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  James spent $20 to go picking and 30 pounds * $1. 5 = $45 for the blueberries.  So in total, he spent $20 + $45 = $65.  If he had bought the blueberries at the store for $2. 5 a pound, that would have cost 30 * $2. 5 = $75.  To compare his two options, James saved  $75 - $65 = $10.   The answer is $10. 
[EXP] 104: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2450, [output]:  When the arms are down, the right foot taps 300 times per minute and the left foot taps 250 times per minute. 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute for both feet.  Since this happens for 3 minutes (5 minutes - 2 minutes), the number of taps for both feet with arms down is 3 * 550 = 1650 times.  With arms up, the rate of taps is 200 for each foot, so it's 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute for both feet.  This happens for 2 minutes, so the number of taps for both feet with arms up is 2 * 400 = 800 times.  In total, Helga taps her feet 1650 + 800 = 2450 times.  The answer is 2450. 
[EXP] 105: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]: 15 + 45 = 60 blue spools in total. 60 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools in total. 60/150 = 40%. 60 is 40% of 150. 40% of her spools are blue.  The answer is 40%. 
[EXP] 106: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 100% of the total votes is the sum of 20% that went to candidate A and 70% that went to candidate B and C. 

There were a total of 100 voters, so candidate A got 20% of 100 votes, which is 20% * 100 = 20 votes. 50% of 20 votes is 10 votes, so candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes. 100 - 20 - 30 is 50, so candidate C got 50 votes.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 107: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]: 1. 80 students in total, with each class having the same amount of students means that each class has 80 / 2 = 40 students. 2.  In each class, 40% of the students are girls. 3.  Since we are dealing with one class, we'll just take the 40 students and calculate 40% of those students that are girls. 40% of 40 is 40 x 0. 4.  So for each class, there are 40 - 16 = 24 boys.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 108: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 3, [output]: 54 students are to be separated into 6 groups.  So the number of students per group is 54 / 6 = 9.  Since the activity needs 12 groups, 6 are already good, so 12 - 6 = 6 more groups are needed.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 109: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]:  There are 33 people in the council.  Assume y is the number of votes against the regulation and y + 2y is the number of votes in favor.  Then, y + 2y = 33.  Solving this equation, we get 3y = 33 and y = 11.  So there were 11 votes against the regulation.   y + 2y is 11 + 22, which is 33.  So the number of votes in favor is 22.  The answer is 22. 
[EXP] 110: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know the total number of cases needed for all three homes is 250.  If we can figure out how many cases the total of the first and third houses need, then we can subtract that from 250 to find the number of cases the second house needs.  

The first house needs 1/2 of the second.  So, if we let x be the second house's cases, the first house needs x/2.  

The third house needs double the first.  So, the third house needs 2*(x/2).  This simplifies to x.  So the first and third houses' cases combined is x + x/2 = 3x/2.   

The total cases needed for the three homes is 250.  So we can set up the equation: 

3x/2 + x = 250

First, we need to get all the x terms on one side: 

4x/2 = 250

Multiply both sides by 2:

4x = 500

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 125

So the second house needs 125 cases of shingles.  

The third house needs twice the first house.  Since the first house needs x/2, the third house will need 2*(x/2) = x = 125.  The third house needs 125 cases of shingles.  The answer is 125. 
[EXP] 111: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents are available. 5 of each vanilla scent sold, so that's 5 * 4 = 20 vanilla scents. 2 of each fruity scent sold, so that's 2 * 8 = 16 fruity scents. 20 - 16 = 4.  So 4 more vanilla scents sold.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 112: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4400, [output]:  Mike started with 600 movies.  A third of those movies are in series.  A third of 600 is 600 / 3 = 200.   So, 200 movies are part of series, leaving 600 - 200 = 400 movies.  Since 40% of those movies are older, 40% of 400 is 40% * 400 = 160.  So, there are 160 older movies, leaving 400 - 160 = 240.  Normal movies will cost $10 each, so they will cost 240 * 10 = 2400.   Older movies will cost $5 each, so they will cost 160 * 5 = 800.  Series movies cost $6, which is cheaper.   So, the cost of buying the series of movies is 200 * 6 = 1200.  The total cost of the movies is 2400 + 800 + 1200 = 4400.  The answer is 4400. 
[EXP] 113: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Andy's car is 10 miles per gallon.  He drives a round trip to work each day, which is 10 miles.  So each day he drives 20 miles.   In a week he drives 20 miles x 5 days = 100 miles.  So he uses 100 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 10 gallons of gas per week.  10 gallons at $3 per gallon is 10 x 3 = $30.  The answer is $30. 
[EXP] 114: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]: 172 people were on the train. 47 people got off. 172 - 47 = 125.  Then 13 more people got on. 125 + 13 = 138.  At the next stop, 38 people got off.  138 - 38 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 115: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Billy was originally paid at a rate of 10 dollars per hour.  Then he was given two raises.  First he got 0. 50 per hour, so his rate increased to 10 + 0. 50 = 10. 50 per hour.   Then he got another raise of 1. 00 per hour, so his rate increased to 10. 50 + 1.  00 = 11. 50 per hour. 

 Billy works 20 hours at this rate.  For 20 hours at 11.  50 per hour, he would earn 20 x 11.  50 = 230.  

 Sally started at a rate of 10. 50 per hour (since she is 0.  50 more per hour than Billy's starting rate).  She also works 20 hours.  For 20 hours at 10.  50 per hour, she earns 20 x 10.  50 = 200.  Billy earns 230 - 200 = 30 dollars more than Sally.   The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 116: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1170, [output]:  James started with the cost of the diamond and gold.  The diamond cost $600 and the gold cost $300, so the total cost is 600 + 300 = 900.  After paying 30% premium, he pays an additional 900 x 0. 3 = 270.  So the total amount he paid is 900 + 270.  900 + 270 is 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
[EXP] 117: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 79, [output]:  Rose started by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each. 3 x 5 = 15 petals.  Then she picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each. 4 x 6 = 24.  Then she picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each. 5 x 4 = 20.  Lastly she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each.  6 x 7 = 42.  Adding those all together gives us the total number of petals before the flowers are dropped.   15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101.  After dropping 1 of each of the types of flowers, that means a total of 4 flowers are dropped, each having 5, 6, 4, and 7 petals respectively.  So the total number of petals dropped is 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22.  101 - 22 is 79.  So the answer is 79. 
[EXP] 118: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 6,250, [output]: 175000 - 50000 = 125000. 125000 is the money raised by the students. 125000 is divided equally among the 20 students.  125000 / 20 = 6250.  The answer is 6250. 
[EXP] 119: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]:  Cindy has 5 green eggs.  She has twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs.  She has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.  Cindy has a total of 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.  The answer is 27. 
[EXP] 120: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  We know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches.   Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.  Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.  There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so we have to convert 480 inches to feet.   480 / 12 = 40 feet.  The answer is 40 feet. 
[EXP] 121: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's break it down:

Glue stick 1: 1/6 of the original 12 mm is left, which is equal to 12 * 1/6 = 2 mm
Glue stick 2: 2/3 of the original 12 mm is left, which is equal to 12 * 2/3 = 8 mm
Glue stick 3: 1/2 of the original 12 mm is left, which is equal to 12 * 1/2 = 6 mm

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is the sum of the remaining lengths: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm

The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 122: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 975, [output]:  Brenda initially had 300 dollars. 3/4 of the original amount is 3/4 * 300 = 225.  So the interest for the first year is 225 dollars. 300 + 225 = 525.  For the second year, she earns interest on 525 dollars. 3/4 * 525 is 393. 525 + 393 = 918.   For the third year, she earns interest on 918 dollars. 3/4 * 918 is 687. 918 + 687 = 1605.  The answer is 1605. 
[EXP] 123: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 144, [output]: 12 homes will be built in the first year.  Then three times as many, which is 3 x 12 = 36, will be built the next year. 12 + 36 = 48.  For the third year, they will double the amount. 48 x 2 = 96.  So they will have built 12 + 48 + 96 = 156 homes over the next three years.  The answer is 156. 
[EXP] 124: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]: 1 year is 12 months.  In a 1 year time frame, Claire will earn 12 badges, Amber will earn 12 / 2 = 6 badges, and Wendy will earn 12 x 3 = 36 badges.  To find out how many more badges Wendy earned compared to Amber, we need to subtract the number of badges Amber earned from the number of badges Wendy earned.  36 - 6 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 125: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  First, let's find out how many jello cups Greg needs. 30 kids, each having 4 cups, means 30 x 4 = 120 cups.  One box of jello makes 10 cups.  So, we need to know how many boxes of jello he needs.   120 / 10 = 12.  So he needs to buy 12 boxes of jello.   Each box is 1. 25.   So, he will spend 1. 25 x 12 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 126: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  Paul had 52 marbles initially.  Then his friend gave him 28, so he got 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.  He has 80 marbles total.   Then he lost 1/4 of his marbles, which is 1/4 x 80 = 20 marbles. 80 - 20 = 60.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 127: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Kelly started with a budget of 65 dollars.  The 5 packs of bacon cost 10 dollars.  The 6 packets of chicken each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon.  A pack of bacon costs 10 / 5 = 2 dollars.  So each packet of chicken costs 2 * 2 = 4 dollars.   6 packets of chicken will cost 6 * 4 = 24 dollars.  The 3 packs of strawberries each cost 4 dollars.   3 * 4 = 12 dollars.  The 7 packs of apples each cost half the price of a pack of strawberries.  A pack of strawberries is 4 dollars, so a pack of apples is 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.  7 packs of apples will cost 7 * 2 = 14 dollars.    The total amount Kelly spends is 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 dollars.  She has 65 - 60 = 5 dollars left in her budget.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 128: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 5 orchids have 5 x 5 = 25 petals. 4 daisies have 4 x 10 = 40 petals.  To find the difference, subtract the orchids' petals from the daisies' petals: 40 - 25 = 15.  The daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 129: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 250, [output]:  John rents his car out 10 times for 3 hours each time. 10 x 3 = 30 hours. 30 hours at $25 an hour is 30 x 25 = 750 dollars. 750 dollars less the 500 dollar car payment is 750 - 500 = 250.  The answer is 250. 
[EXP] 130: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 16, [output]:  We'll start by calculating how much material Jo needs for the small masks. 20 small masks require 20/4 = 5 times 2 yards of material. 5 x 2 is 10 yards.  Then we'll calculate the material needed for the large masks. 8 large masks require 8/3 = 2. 67.  but since we don't have 1/3 of a yard, we'll round it up to 3 yards (2. 25).  In total, Jo needs 10 + 3 = 13 yards of material.  The answer is 13 yard. 
[EXP] 131: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 700, [output]:  First, we need to find the number of acres in Farmer Smith's farm. 200 times 2 is 400. 400 + 100 = 500.  So Farmer Smith's farm has 500 acres.  In total, the two farms have 200 + 500 = 700 acres.  The answer is 700. 
[EXP] 132: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Let's start by finding the total number of pieces of fruit Kira bought: 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges.  We can add these numbers together to get the total number of pieces: 3 + 5 + 6 = 14.  After Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit, Kira has 14 - 2 = 12 pieces of fruit left.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 133: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 4 hours is the time the sloth takes for each trip. 8 hours is the total time available for the sloth to collect berries.  So the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours is 8 / 4 = 2.  If he collects the same number of berries per trip, let's call this number "x".  Then, x * 2 = 24.  To find x, we do 24 / 2 = 12.  This is the minimum number of berries he can collect per trip and achieve 24 berries in 8 hours.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let John's age be x.  Since Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul's age is x + 10.  Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age.   So, Peter's age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10.  The combined age is 100, so we set up the equation:

x + x + 10 + x = 100

This simplifies to 3x + 10 = 100.  Subtract 10 from both sides:

3x = 90

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 30

So John's age is 30.  Since Paul is 10 years older, Paul's age is 30 + 10 = 40.  Since Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, Peter's age is 30 + 40 = 70.  The answer is 70. 
[EXP] 135: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Let's first calculate how much money John earned in total. 50 dollars per hour * 6 hours = 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.  After spending 50 dollars on gas, John will have 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.  He wants to deposit 100 dollars into the bank.   So he will have 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left.  Now, each pen costs 25 dollars, so we want to find how many pens 150 dollars will buy.  To do this, we can divide:

150 / 25 = 6.  So, John can buy 6 pens.   Now, he also wants to buy 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each.  To find how much he will spend on pencils, multiply:

10 * 5 = 50.   So, John will spend 50 dollars on pencils.  After buying pencils, the amount of money he has left is the 150 he had minus the 50 he spent:

150 - 50 = 100.  Now, John's goal is to buy pens.  He has 100 dollars and each pen costs 25 dollars.   To find the number of pens he can buy:

100 / 25 = 4.  Since he cannot buy a fraction of a pen, the answer is 4. 
[EXP] 136: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]: James swam across 20 miles. 60% of 20 is 60/100 x 20 = 12. 12 is the distance he swam.  To find the time he swam that distance, we divide 12 by 2, his speed.  12/2 is 6.   That was the time he swam 12 miles.  After that, he rests for half that time.   6/2 is 3.  So he rests for 3 hours.   Then he has 20 - 12 = 8 miles left.  He goes at half his original speed, which is 1 mile per hour.    So to find the time he takes to swim those 8 miles, we divide 8 by 1.  8/1 is 8.   Adding 6 + 3 + 8, we get 17.  The answer is 17. 
[EXP] 137: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 360, [output]:  We need to calculate the total number of 15-minute periods during the time Vince was stapling reports. 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. 15 hours * 4 15-minute periods per hour = 60 15-minute periods.  Now, we can use Vince's rate to find the total number of reports he stapled. 30 reports every 15 minutes means he staples 2 reports per minute.  So he staples 120 reports per 30 minutes. 60 * 120 = 7200 reports.  The answer is 7200. 
[EXP] 138: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Jason picked up and carried 2 balls.  Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey must have carried 1 ball (half of Jason's amount).   Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan must have carried 4 balls (twice Jason's amount).  So in total, 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 balls were picked up and carried.   This is all that was left of the balls, because they were carried in one trip and there were no balls left on the gym floor.  Therefore, 7 is one third of the total number of balls the coach brought to practice.  If 7 is one third, then 7 * 3 = 21 is the total number of balls.   The answer is 21. 
[EXP] 139: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]:  Greta made a batch for herself, which is 1 dozen (12) brownies.  At her office party, they sent her home with 1/2 dozen (6) brownies.  So she had 12 + 6 = 18 brownies.   When she got home, her friends gave her 4 dozen (48) brownies.  So she now had 18 + 48 = 66 brownies.   1 1/2 dozen (18) were eaten during the party.  So she had 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left.  The answer is 48. 
[EXP] 140: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 79, [output]:  The number of states in the USA is 50.  Half of 50 is 25, so 4 more than half is 25 + 4 = 29.  India has 29 states.   The total number of states in both countries is 29 + 50 = 79.  The answer is 79. 
[EXP] 141: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step.  Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.   Her sister gave her 10 more than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.  Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother, so her friend gave her 20 x 2 = 40 beads.   If we add them all up, we get: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.  The answer is 90. 
[EXP] 142: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 30 pounds of soil are bought.  Each sunflower needs 3 pounds, so 4 sunflowers will take 4 x 3 = 12 pounds. 10 carnations need 10 x 1. 5 = 15 pounds. 12 + 15 is 27 pounds. 30 - 27 is 3 pounds left.  Each rose needs 1 pound, so 3 pounds can plant 3 roses.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 143: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  To start, we know Tobias howls for 20 seconds.  Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which means Chikote howls for 20 * 2 = 40 seconds.   Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  The sum of the other two wolves combined is 20 + 40 = 60.  Hence, Igneous howls for 60 seconds.  In total, the three wolves howl for 20 + 40 + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.  Since 60 seconds = 1 minute, we can divide 120 seconds by 60 to get the total number of minutes.  120 / 60 = 2.   The answer is 2 minutes. 
[EXP] 144: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 20 minutes to make the cake batter, 30 minutes to bake the cake, 2 hours to cool, and 10 minutes to frost. 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.  180 minutes = 3 hours.  So everything will take 3 hours.   If she wants to serve it at 5:00 pm, she should start 3 hours earlier.  3 hours before 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.  She should start making the cake at 2:00 pm.  The answer is 2:00 pm. 
[EXP] 145: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 230, [output]:  First, we need to calculate how many miles Matteo drove. 55 mph for 4 hours is: 55 x 4 = 220 miles.   Shandy drove at 45 mph for 10 hours, which is: 45 x 10 = 450 miles.  To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove, subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance.  450 - 220 = 230.  The answer is 230. 
[EXP] 146: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 78, [output]: 15 packs of sweets, and each pack has 60 pieces. 15 x 60 = 900 pieces of sweets in total. 2 packs were kept, so 2 x 60 = 120 pieces were kept. 900 - 120 = 780 pieces were given to friends. 780 pieces divided equally among 10 friends will be 780 / 10 = 78. 78 sweets for each friend.  The answer is 78. 
[EXP] 147: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, let's say she sold x large and 2*x small stuffed animals. 

Let's first consider the price of the large stuffed animals. 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal means 3*4 = 12 dollars.  So the cost of 1 large stuffed animal is 12 dollars.  

The total cost of all large stuffed animals is 12*x.  The total cost of all small stuffed animals is 4*2*x = 8*x.  The total cost is 120 dollars.  So we can set up the equation:
12*x + 8*x = 120
20*x = 120
x = 6
So she sold 6 large and 12 small stuffed animals.  The question asks how many small stuffed animals were sold, so the answer is 12. 
[EXP] 148: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step!


First, 40% of the red balloons burst, and there were 25 red balloons originally. 40% of 25 is 10, so 10 red balloons burst. 25 - 10 = 15. 


Next, 50% of the 12 yellow balloons were released, which means 6 yellow balloons were released. 12 - 6 = 6.  So, she was left with 6 yellow balloons.  The number of red balloons left is 15, and the number of yellow balloons left is 6.  There were 7 green balloons initially.  In total, there were 15 + 6 + 7 = 28 balloons.  Then, she found 8 blue balloons and took 75% of them.  75% of 8 is 6.  So, she took 6 blue balloons and had 28 + 6 = 34 balloons in total.  The answer is 34.

The answer is 247. 
[EXP] 154: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 251, [output]:  First, let's find the total number of guests. 25 classmates, 7 girls in her dance class, and 13 family members would be 25 + 7 + 13 = 45. 4 people couldn't come, so the total number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41. 

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest.  Since the party is for 41 guests, 41 - 20 = 21, which means there are 21 additional guests. 21 x $6 is $126. 125 + 126 = $251.  The answer is 251. 
[EXP] 155: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 10 * 12 = 120. 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks she still needs to save. 80 / 10 is 8, so it will take her 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks. 8 + 12 = 20 weeks.  The answer is 8.

[EXP] 168: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Ronnie was given $5.  Rissa was given 5 x 3 = 15 dollars.  Then they each gave their little sister some money.  Let's figure out how much Rissa has left after giving her sister some money.  She has 15 dollars, but after giving her sister some money, she is left with 4/5 of that, which means she has 15 - 15/5 dollars left.   That is 15 - 3 = 12 dollars.  So Rissa gave her sister 15 - 12 = 3 dollars.  Since both children gave their sister the same amount, Ronnie also gave her sister 3 dollars.  Ronnie had 5 dollars, so if he gave his sister 3 dollars, he had 5 - 3 dollars left. 5 - 3 dollars = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 169: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 5 inches is the original length of chalk.  Since the teacher used 45% of it on Monday, that means 45% of 5 inches was used. 45% of 5 is calculated by multiplying 0. 45 by 5, which gives us 2. 2 is 40% of 5, so the teacher has used 2 inches of chalk. 5 - 2 = 3, so 3 inches of chalk remain.  The teacher will use 20% of the chalk each day. 20% of 5 is calculated by multiplying 0. 20 by 5, which gives 1. 1 is 20% of 5, so the teacher will use 1 inch of chalk each day.  Since 3 inches of chalk remain, we can divide 3 by 1 to see how many days the teacher has left: 3 / 1 = 3.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 170: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 11, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

Originally, two apples fell out of the tree. 1 apple landed on Newton's head and the other he picked up. 1

Newton put 1 in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree.  This caused 5 more apples to fall out. 1 + 5 = 6

Newton picked up the 6 apples and put all but 1 in his pocket.  1

Now he threw the remaining apple at the tree.  This caused 6 more apples to fall out.   1 + 6 = 7

Newton picked up all the remaining apples.  He had 1 + 6 = 7 apples.   He went home with these 7 apples.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 171: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 19, [output]:  Let's break down the problem:

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.  So, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.  This is our starting point for the second day. 

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than on the first day.  So they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.  

They ordered no more bandages on the second day.  So, they still had 12 bandages left.  In total, they used 12 + 28 = 40 bandages.  

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.  They used half of one pack.   So, they used 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.  In total, they used 100 - 25 = 75 bandages.   

They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.  They started with 78 - 75 = 3 bandages on the third day.   However, before the third day, they used 40 bandages.  So, they had 3 + 40 = 43 bandages before the third day.    Before the third day, they used 12 bandages.  So, they had 43 + 12 = 55 bandages before the second day.  So, they started with 55 - 38 = 17 bandages on the first day.  The answer is 17. 
[EXP] 172: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2400, [output]:  John starts with 10 scotch bottles, which cost $600.  So each scotch bottle costs $600 รท 10 = $60.  He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch.  So he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.  Since the cognac is 50% more expensive than the scotch, the cognac costs $90 per bottle.  So he spends 20 * 90 = 1800 on cognac.  He also spent 600 on scotch, for a total of 1800 + 600 = 2400.  The answer is 2400. 
[EXP] 173: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 168, [output]: 20 tourists found 700 shells. 40% of the shells were found by Alphas.  So Alphas found 700 * 40% = 280 shells.  We now have 700 - 280 = 420 shells remaining.  The finders found 60% of the remaining shells.   So they found 420 * 60% = 252 shells.  We now know that Alphas and The finders found 280 + 252 = 532 shells.  So the Gogetters must have found 700 - 532 = 168 shells.  The answer is 168. 
[EXP] 174: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 448, [output]: 3 times the amount of the first medicine means the second medicine is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.  So the total amount of medicine in one dosage is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.  For 8 doses, the amount of medicine would be 56 * 8 = 448.  The answer is 448. 
[EXP] 175: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 225, [output]:  There are 10 students in each grade, with grades 4 to 7.  So there are 4 * 10 = 40 students to try the escape room.  But only 8 students can try the escape room at a time.   To find out how many groups they can have, divide the total students by the number that can go at a time. 40 / 8 = 5.  It will take 5 groups to complete all students.  Since each group takes 45 minutes, it will take 5 * 45 = 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.  The answer is 225 minutes. 
[EXP] 176: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Let's start by using a variable to represent the number of cupcakes Carly makes.  Call it "c".  Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.  We can represent this with the equation:

Brownies = 3c - 2

We know that each person gets two treats, so the total number of treats is 2 times the number of people, or 2 x 5 = 10.  Since Carly is only making cupcakes and brownies, the total number of treats she is making is equal to the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies.  So we can set up the equation:

c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combine like terms to get:

4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides to get:

4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for c:

c = 3

So Carly made 3 cupcakes.  The answer is 3.

Dexter has ordered 300 pounds of feed, so he has 300 - 280 = 20 pounds of feed left.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 185: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 34, [output]:  We need to first find the total time Charisma spends meditating each day.  She meditates for 15 minutes 2 times a day. 15 + 15 = 30 minutes.  A day.  She practices yoga for an hour each day.   So for 5 days a week, she practices yoga for 5 * 60 = 300 minutes each week.  Then we need to do the same amount of yoga for 4 weeks, so 4 * 300 = 1200.  To find the total meditation/yoga time in 4 weeks, add the meditation time with the yoga time.   Each day, Charisma practices 30 minutes of meditation and 1 hour of yoga, so each day is 30 + 60 = 90 minutes.  Now we do that each day for 5 days a week, then 5 * 90 = 450 each week.  Again we do that 4 weeks, so 450 * 4 = 1800.   Combining the total time meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we get 1800 (meditation and yoga) + 1200(yoga) = 3000 minutes, or 3000/60 = 50 hours.  The answer is 50 hours. 
[EXP] 186: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  Ryan gets 6 dollars per week for completing his chores, and he did chores for 3 weeks.  So he earned a total of 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.  Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends for 1. 25 each.  Since there are 4 people including Ryan, that's 4 x 1. 25 = 5 dollars.   So he spent 5 dollars on ice cream.  Now he has 18 - 5 = 13 dollars left.   To find out how many movie tickets he can buy, we just need to divide 13 by 6.  13 / 6 is 2 with a remainder of 1.  So he can buy 2 movie tickets with 1 dollar left over.  The answer is 2.
