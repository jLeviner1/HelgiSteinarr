[EXP] 1: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.  She eats 3 for breakfast, and bakes 4 muffins for her friends.   The remainder she sells at the farmers' market. 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs were sold at the market . 9 eggs x $2 per egg = 18 dollars.  Janet makes 18 dollars selling eggs at the market.  The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 2: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 160, [output]: 200 GB is the total file size.  Carla normally downloads 2 GB per minute.  40% of 200 is 80 GB. 80 GB downloaded means 80 of the 200 are done.   So she still needs to download 200 - 80 = 120 GB.  Carla downloaded 80 GB normally, at a rate of 2 GB per minute.   So it took 80/2 = 40 minutes to download 80 GB.  40 minutes for the initial download.   When Windows restarts, 40% of the download so far, or 80 GB, has to be redone.  So she will need to download the same 80 GB again.   80 GB at a download rate of 2 GB per minute will take 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.  So the second part of the download will take 40 minutes.   Since Carla will start over, she will be waiting 20 minutes for the updates to install, so the 40 minutes downloading is after 20 minutes.  So the total time is 40 (first download) + 20 (waiting for updates) + 40 (second download) = 100 minutes.  100 minutes total download time.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 3: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]: 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 is 4 students. 20 - 4 is 16 students left.  Then 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of 16 is 4 students.  So 16 - 4 = 12 students are left to enroll in hip-hop dance.  There are 20 students total, so 12 students out of 20 enrolled in hip-hop dance.   To find the percentage, divide 12 by 20 and multiply by 100. 12/20 * 100 is 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
[EXP] 4: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Samantha is 31.  Raymond was born 6 years before her, so he is 31 - 6 = 25.  He had a son when he was 23 years old.   So Raymond's son must have been born 25 - 23 = 2 years after Raymond was born.  Samantha's current age is 31, so 2 years ago was Samantha's age 29.   Since Raymond's son was born 2 years ago, his birth year is the same as Samantha's age (29).  The answer is 29. 
[EXP] 5: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]: 60 miles from the beginning of the trip. 20 miles are traveled until the first stop.  So, from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.  The second stop is 15 miles before the end.   So, 40 - 15 = 25 miles he traveled between his first and second stops.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 6: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Mike started scoring points 20 minutes in.  Then he scored 4 points.  The next 20 minutes, he scores 25% more, which means 25% of 4 is 1.  1 more point than the 4 points is 4 + 1 = 5.   Then, 4 + 5 = 9.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 7: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]: 5 pies were cut into 8 pieces each.  So there were 5 * 8 = 40 pieces of pie in total.  After the guests took and ate their pieces, 14 pieces remained.   So, the guests took 40 - 14 = 26 pieces of pie.  The answer is 26. 
[EXP] 8: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]: 1. 15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units in total. 3/4 of 120 is 90.  120 - 90 = 30.  The answer is 30.

[EXP] 10: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 1596, [output]: 140 dollars per month. 140 x 6 = 840 for the first half of the year.  The second half of the year is 7 months. 140 x 10% = 14, then 140 - 14 = 126.  126 x 7 is 882.  882 + 840 = 1722.  The answer is 1722. 
[EXP] 11: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7425, [output]: 5 dance classes per day, Monday to Friday, makes 5 * 5 = 25 classes. 8 classes on Saturday, makes a total of 25 + 8 = 33 classes.  If each class has 15 students, then in total there are 15 * 33 = 495 students.  If she charges 15 dollars per student, then the total amount of money she makes is 15 x 495 = 7425.  The answer is 7425. 
[EXP] 12: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Let's start with Sarah doing 400 pounds of laundry.  If Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, then David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry. 

  Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.  Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.  The difference is 200 - 100 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 13: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 22 games in total were played. 8 more were won than lost.  So if we assume they lost x, then they won x + 8.  x + (x + 8) = 22.  Simplify the left side to get 2x + 8 = 22.  Subtract 8 from both sides to get 2x = 14.  Divide both sides by 2 to get x = 7.  So they must have lost 7 and won 7 + 8 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 14: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 28, [output]:  Let's start by finding Marcia's number of pets.  Cindy has 4 pets.  Marcia has 2 more than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. 

Since Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, Jan has 6 * 3 = 18 pets.  Now we have Cindy with 4 pets, Marcia with 6 pets, and Jan with 18 pets.  In total, they have 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets.  The answer is 28. 
[EXP] 15: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 30 cars were originally on the motorway.  5 cars left the motorway, so there are 30 - 5 = 25 cars remaining.  In total, 20 cars drove through the traffic jam, so the rest must have driven through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.   That is, 25 - 20 = 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 16: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Amir eats 5 cookies.   Since Cody eats 3 times as many as Amir, Cody eats 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.  So, in total, they eat 5 + 15 = 20 cookies.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 17: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]: 4 teachers take turns, each using the whiteboard 2 times a day, so the whiteboard is used 4 * 2 = 8 times a day.  If the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times during each of these 8 uses, the whiteboard is cleaned 3 * 8 = 24 times in a day.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 18: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 95200, [output]: 30% higher means that Adrien's original salary was 30% more than Lylah's.  So let's say Lylah's original salary was x.  Adrien's salary was 1. 3x, since it's 30% more.  Now, we know Adrien's original salary was actually 40000, so 1.  3x is equal to 40000.  Let's solve for x: 1. 3x = 40000.  Divide both sides by 1. 3 to get x = 40000/3.   x is equal to 13333.  3x, Adrien's original salary, is 40000.   Now, we know Adrien's salary 4 years later increased by 40%.  We also know Adrien's original salary was 40000.  His new salary, after increasing by 40%, is 40000 + 40% of 40000.   40% of 40000 is 16000.  Now, we add that to Adrien's original salary: 40000 + 16000 is 56000.   Lylah's salary 4 years later is also 40% higher than it used to be.  If her original salary was 13333, 40% of 13333 is 5333.  So her new salary is 13333 + 5333 = 18666.   Finally, the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah is the sum of their new salaries: 56000 + 18666 = 74666.  The answer is 74666. 
[EXP] 19: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 82, [output]:  Dylan started with 38 chicken sausages.  For fish sausages, he bought 6 more than the chicken sausages.  38 + 6 = 44.  So he bought 44 fish sausages.  In total, he bought 44 + 38 = 82 sausages.  The answer is 82. 
[EXP] 20: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  We first find out the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday.  Walt walked 4 miles on Monday.  He walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday, so he walked 4 * 6 = 24 miles.  In total, he walked 4 + 24 = 28 miles on Monday and Tuesday.  His total miles on Monday through Wednesday was 41.  So he walked 41 - 28 = 13 miles on Wednesday.  The answer is 13. 
[EXP] 21: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 20 cars are available in total. 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. 12 + 4 = 16 are either automatic or manual. 20 - 16 = 4 cars are semi-automatic.  To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100. 4/20 x 100 = 20%.  The answer is 20%. 
[EXP] 22: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 75, [output]: 30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours.  Then, 1/2 that many bees returned in the next 6 hours. 1/2 of 30 is 15, so 15 bees returned in the next 6 hours.   Then, 2 times as many bees left as left the hive originally, which is 2 x 30 = 60. 60 bees left the hive in the next 6 hours.    Finally, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours.  So, 30 bees return to the hive.   In the last 6 hours, 30 bees return.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 23: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 272, [output]: 3 classes per day, for 3 days a week, means 9 classes per week.  Each class is 1 hour long, so in total that is 9 hours per week.  On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 2-hour classes each day.  2 classes per day for 2 days a week is 4 classes per week.   Each class is 2 hours long, so that is 8 hours per week.  Adding the 9 hours with the 8 hours, Kimo goes to school for a total of 9 + 8 = 17 hours per week.  One semester has 16 weeks, so Kimo spends 16 * 17 hours = 272 hours attending classes.  The answer is 272. 
[EXP] 24: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]:  Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 10 + 6 + 3 is 19.  Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish (10 - 5 = 5), 3 fewer sea horses (6 - 3 = 3), and 2 more clownfish (3 + 2 = 5). 5 + 3 + 5 is 13. 19 + 13 is 32.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 25: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Ethel has 8 dollars. 2 times Ethel's money is 2 x 8 = 16.  Jimmy has 2 more than that, which is 16 + 2 = 18.  The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 26: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  First, let's find the total amount they spent on lemons and sugar by calculating the cost of making one gallon of lemonade, and then multiply that by the number of gallons they made. 

Cost of lemons for 1 gallon = $3
Cost of sugar for 1 gallon = $2
Total cost for 1 gallon = $3 + $2 = $5

Cost for 1 glass = $0. 00 (since they are selling each glass for $0. 50)

Number of glasses per gallon = 20

So the amount they make from selling one gallon = 20 * $0. 50 = $10

Profit from selling one gallon = $10 - $5 = $5

In total they made $25 in profit, so to find out how many gallons they made we can set up an equation:

5 x number of gallons = 25

Number of gallons = 25 / 5 = 5

So they made 5 gallons.  

Now let's know the cost for lemons and sugar for 5 gallons:
Cost of lemons for 5 gallons = 5 x $3 = $15
Cost of sugar for 5 gallons = 5 x $2 = $10
Total cost of lemons and sugar = $15 + $10 = $25.  The answer is $15. 
[EXP] 27: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 23, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that Jean is 2 years older than Mark.  So, let M be the age of Mark, then the age of Jean will be M+2.  

Second, we know that two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.  Jan is 30, so two years ago Jan's age was 30-2=28.   So, two years ago Mark's age was 5 years more than half Jan's age.  In other words:

M-2= (28/2)+5

M-2= 14+5

M-2= 19

M= 19+2

M= 21

So now we know that Mark is 21.  Jean is 2 years older than Mark, so Jean is 21+2=23.  The answer is 23. 
[EXP] 28: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]: 3 friends spent 20. 25 dollars on 3 tickets.  So 20. 25 / 3 = 6. 83.   We also know that $4. 50 less on food than on the tickets, so food was 20.  25 - 4. 50 = 15. 75.  3 friends went on 2 different rides which cost 33 for each ride, so 2 x 33 = 66.  20.  25 + 15.   75 + 66 = 102.  Total cost.  102 dollars in total.  Split evenly among 3 friends.  102 / 3 = 34.   So each friend paid $34.  The answer is 34. 
[EXP] 29: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]: 200 pounds of carrots are to be distributed.  Each restaurant gets 2 pounds, and there are 40 restaurants.  So, 2 x 40 = 80 pounds will be used.  200 - 80 is 120.   The answer is 120 pounds of carrots will not be used. 
[EXP] 30: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 31, [output]: 6 + 6 + 8 = 20. 20 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 27. 

Steps:
- 6 slices for 3 sandwiches at lunch (3 * 2 = 6 slices of cheese)
- 3 days for breakfast with 1 more slice per omelet than per sandwich (3 * 3 = 9, used only 3 slices)
- 8 slices for the big dish of macaroni and cheese. 6 + 1 + 1 - 2 = 6 + 8 = 14

Carl used 6 + 6 + 8 = 20 slices of cheese. 14 slices are for the big dish, 6 slices are for sandwiches, and the 3 remaining are for omelets. 20 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 27.  Carrie just lied. 20 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 26. 20 - 9 = 11. 9 isn’t 3. 20 + 8 = 28.  The answer is 20 slices of cheese. 
[EXP] 31: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Sara starts with $10 dollars.  She will earn money from babysitting and mowing the lawn.  The jacket costs $30 and 2 pairs of shoes cost $20 x 2 = $40.  So in total, she needs $30 + $40 = $70.   To find out how much more money she needs to make:  $70 - $10 = $60.  She will earn $5 each time she babysits.  So the number of times she must babysit to earn $60 is $60/$5 = 12.   After she has done that, she will have enough money from babysitting to buy the jacket and shoes.  To get the rest of the money, she must mow the lawn.   Each time mowing the lawn earns her $4.  The total amount of money she needs from mowing the lawn is $60 - $60 ($5 * 12) = $0.  She has not used this money yet, so she can stop after the 12 times she needs to babysit.   She will have enough money after babysitting 12 times.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 32: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 7 flowers more than roses means dahlias = 4 + 7 = 11.  The total number of flowers in the vase is 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 33: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 180, [output]:  Carlos rents the canoe for 3 hours at $30 an hour, so he paid 3 x 30 = 90 dollars.  Benji rents the raft for 5 hours at 18 dollars an hour, so he paid 5 x 18 = 90 dollars.  The total they paid is 90 + 90 = 180 dollars.  The answer is 180.

[EXP] 35: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 68, [output]:  Let's start by finding Joan's age.  Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25.  Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23.  Now we can find the sum of their ages:  20 + 25 + 23 = 68.   The answer is 68. 
[EXP] 36: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Let's first find the difference in snails between the two aquariums: 32 - 4 = 28 snails. 

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.  So, the number of fish in both aquariums is:

28 / 2 = 14

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 37: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 73, [output]:  Rick originally killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.  So in total, he killed 10 + 15 = 25 animals.  Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.  Since he killed 15 cougars the previous night, he killed 15 x 3 = 45 wolves today.   He also killed 3 fewer cougars than the previous night, so he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.  In total, Rick killed 45 + 12 = 57 animals.   Adding this to the 25 animals from the previous night, he killed 57 + 25 = 82 animals in total.  The answer is 82. 
[EXP] 38: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 168, [output]:  Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, let's say Jamal has x apples.  And then Andrea has x + 8 apples. 

We know Andrea has 52 apples, so x + 8 = 52.  Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get x = 44.  So Jamal has 44 apples.  Now Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.  So Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.  

We know Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 ÷ 2 = 24 bananas.  Adding the number of apples and bananas, we have Andrea has 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits total.  The answer is 76. 
[EXP] 39: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 118000, [output]: 400000 is the selling price of the house.  3% of 400000 is 3/100 * 400000 = 12000.  5% of 400000 is 5/100 * 400000 = 20000.   Total fees paid is 12000 + 20000 = 32000.  So Mr.  Tan got 400000 - 32000 = 368000.  After paying the remaining loan amount of 250000, he is left with 368000 - 250000 = 118000.   The answer is 118000. 
[EXP] 40: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 315, [output]: 900 stitches for the body of the sweater, 900 ÷ 10 = 90 stitches for the collar.  The rosette takes twice as much as the collar, so it takes 90 x 2 = 180 stitches. 1800 stitches for the whole project, minus 900 for the body and 90 for the collar, minus 180 for the rosette is 1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630.  So there are 630 stitches left for the 2 sleeves. 630 ÷ 2 is 315.  The answer is 315 stitches per sleeve.

The remaining stars are 76 - 36 = 40 stars. 40 stars divided evenly into groups of 5 is 40 / 5 = 8.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 43: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Will starts with 15 oranges.  The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges.  The youngest son is half as old, which is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.  So he washes 4 oranges.   In total, 8 + 4 = 12 oranges are washed.  So 15 - 12 = 3 oranges are left unwashed.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 44: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 1 piece of paper. 1 piece of paper can be folded in half, creating 2 sides.  Each side can be used for a page.  "The left back" can be any side, it can be page 1 or page 32, or any other.  Same with "the left front", "the right back" and "the right front".  So 1 piece of paper can be used to make 4 pages.  For a 32-page tabloid, 8 pieces of paper would be necessary, each one providing 4 pages.  However, this can be simplified.  For each set of 4 pages, one piece of paper is used.  So we can use 32 / 4 = 8 pieces of paper.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 45: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]: 2 tubs of ice cream at $2 discount each will be 2 x 2 = 4 dollars saved.  A packet of milk at $0. 5 discount is $0. 5 saved.  For 4 packets, that is 0. 5 x 4 = 2 dollars saved.  So in total, you will save 4 + 2 = 6 dollars.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 46: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Martha invited 2 families with 6 people, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 people.  She also invited 3 families with 4 people, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 people. 12 + 12 = 24, so she invited 24 people in total.  

8 people couldn't come due to illness. 1/4 of 8 people is 8 / 4 = 2 people, and 2 people already couldn't come due to illness, so 2 more still couldn't make it due to previous commitments.  8 + 2 = 10 people couldn't come, so 10 people didn't show up.  24 - 10 = 14 people show up for Martha's party.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 47: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Jam started with 3 boxes.  With the 2 loose pencils, they had 26 pencils in total. 3 boxes is 3 x ? = 26.  3 x 8 = 24, 3 x 9 = 27, so 3 x 9 is 27.  Jam's pencils are in 3 boxes.  Meg had 46 pencils.   Jam and Meg's pencils together are 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.  72 pencils require 72 ÷ 8 = 9 boxes.   Jam has 3 boxes, and Meg would need 9 - 3 = 6 boxes of pencils.  The total number of boxes needed by Jam and Meg is 3 + 6 = 9.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 48: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Erin started with 7 lollipops.  Her mother gave her 10 more, so now she has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.  After giving 3 lollipops to Ella, she has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 49: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 72, [output]:  Maria started with 8 shares of stock, each costing $8.  So the initial value of her shares is 8 * 8 = 64 dollars.  During the first year, the stock price increases by 50%, which means the price of each share becomes 8 * 1. 5 = 12.   So the value of all her shares becomes 8 * 12 = 96 dollars.  During the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%, which means the price of each share becomes 12 * (1 - 0. 25) = 9.  So the value of all her shares is now 8 * 9 = 72 dollars.  The answer is 72. 
[EXP] 50: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 180000, [output]:  Tyson runs 5000 meters per day. 1/5 times more meters is 5000 * 1/5 = 1000 meters. 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters per day.  For a month, since there are 30 days in a month, the total distance he covered is 30 * 6000 meters = 180,000 meters.  The answer is 180,000. 
[EXP] 51: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Peyton had 1 hour of yoga class on monday. 3 times longer that is 1 * 3 = 3 hours of cooking class on tuesday.  On wednesday, it was a half-hour cheese tasting.  On thursday, the museum tour was half as long as the cooking class.  The cooking class was 3 hours long, so the museum tour was 3/2 = 1. 5 hours.   Finally, there were 2 hours of errands on friday.  In total, that is 1 + 3 + 0. 5 + 1.  5 + 2 = 8.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 52: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Morgan's dad gave her 90 dollars.  A round of mini golf is 5 dollars.  The arcade tokens are 5 dollars.   Rounding the go-karts twice will cost 2 x 10 = 20 dollars.  So in total that's 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 dollars.  She has 90 dollars in total.  If she has 30 dollars spent, she has 90 - 30 = 60 dollars left.  So the remaining money will go to her friends.  So 60 divided by 5 is 12.  So she can invite 12 friends.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 53: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 49, [output]: 96 fourth-graders were originally at the school, and 43 are girls.  So, 96 - 43 = 53 must be the number of boys.  Then, 4 boys were absent, leaving 53 - 4 = 49 boys.  The answer is 49. 
[EXP] 54: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 14 pairs were sold on friday.  On saturday, they sold double that, which is 2 * 14 = 28.  On sunday, they sold one half of the number they did the day before, which is 1/2 * 28 = 14.   Then, six people returned their shoes, and 14 - 6 = 8.  The shoes sold on friday, saturday, and sunday were 14 + 28 + 14 = 56, minus the 6 returns, which is 50. 

The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 55: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 50 socks need washing.  10 pairs of socks is 20 socks. 15 loose socks are 15 socks.  In total, Lindsay has washed 20 + 15 = 35 socks. 50 - 35 = 15 socks are missing.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 56: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]: 50% of the choir are boys, so 100% - 50% = 50% are girls. 50% of 52 is 26.  So there are 26 girls and 26 boys.  But originally, they decided to only have the girls perform, so the number of girls is the one relevant number.  Now, half the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down.   So half of 26 is 13, and 26 - 13 = 13.  So 13 girls perform.  Then 3 teachers also perform.   13 + 3 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 57: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]:  Let's first calculate the monthly cost for the streaming services.  Netflix is $10.  Hulu and Disney Plus together is 10 + 10 = 20, but he saves 20% for bundling.   So the combined cost is 20 - 20% of 20.  20% of 20 is 4.  20 - 4 is 16.  Now we can add up the total cost of the streaming services: 10 + 16 is 26.  Now we compare that to the original cable cost: 26 vs 60.  The difference is 60 - 26 = 34.  The answer is 34. 
[EXP] 58: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Alice is 7 years older than Beth, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica.  If Erica is 30 years old, then Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old.  And Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice must be 35 + 7 = 42 years old.  To find the difference between their ages, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age, so 42 - 30 = 12.   The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 59: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 200, [output]:  Allan started with 40 cannolis.  Then he bought 60 more, so he had 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.  He had twice as much corn as cannolis, so he had 100 x 2 = 200 corns.  However, he bought 40 fewer corns, so he actually has 200 - 40 = 160 corns.  The total number of corns and cannolis is 160 + 100 = 260.  The answer is 260. 
[EXP] 60: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]: 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode.  That means that 1% of the candles may explode. 1% of 50000 is 500.  Also, 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.  5% of 50000 is 2500.  The problem is asking us to find the overlap between the two groups - the candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.   We know that 1% of the candles explode, and 5% of the candles have a bad smell.  However, since these are not the same fraction, we can just multiply the number of candles that explode by the percentage that have a bad smell:

500 (candles that may explode) * 0. 05 (percentage with bad smell) = 25

So there are 25 candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 61: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17000, [output]:  Mr.  Josue started with 5000 dollars of capital.  The first bank gave him 4000 dollars.  Then the second company gave him 4000 x 2 = 8000 dollars.   Adding the 4000 and 8000 to his initial 5000, we get 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 dollars.  The answer is 17000 dollars. 
[EXP] 62: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 150, [output]: 1st, we know that Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards.  This means that he got rid of 2/3 of the cards, to sell them.  That means that he got 50 dollars from selling those cards.  If each card sold was $1. 5, then the number of cards he sold is the total amount he sold divided by the price per card.   50 / 1. 5 is 33. 33 is the number of cards Kenny sold.   From that, we can find the number of cards Kenny started with. 33 is 2/3 of the cards, so the total is 33 * 3/2 = 50 cards.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 63: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Let's first calculate how many cents George had initially.  5 dollars is 500 cents.  If he had 1% of his money left, that means 1% of 500 is left.  1% of 500 is 5.  So he spent 500 - 5 = 495 cents.  George spent this money on chips and candy bars.   Each chip costs 40 cents.  He bought 3 bags.   40 * 3 = 120.  So he spent 120 cents on chips.  He had 495 - 120 = 375 cents left.   Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide 375 by 75 to find out how many candy bars he bought.  375 / 75 = 5.   The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 64: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads.  So she bought 1 + 2 = 3 packs of beads.  Each pack has 20 beads, so she has 3 x 20 = 60 beads.   Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads.  3 + 4 = 7 packs of beads.   Each pack has 20 beads, so she has 7 x 20 = 140 beads.  Between the two sisters, 140 - 60 = 80 beads.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 65: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 539, [output]:  The salesman bought 48 sneakers for 576 dollars.  17 sneakers were sold at 20 dollars each on Monday, which is 17 x 20 = 340 dollars.  48 - 17 = 31 sneakers are left.  31 sneakers at 25 dollars each is 31 x 25 = 775 dollars.  The total amount of money he has is 340 + 775 = 1115 dollars.  He originally paid 576 dollars, so his profit is 1115 - 576 = 539 dollars.  The answer is 539. 
[EXP] 66: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1920, [output]: 1 bed is 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.  For 10 beds, it's 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet of soil needed. 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag = 160 bags of potting soil.  160 bags * 12 dollars per bag = 1920.  The answer is 1920. 
[EXP] 67: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 71, [output]:  Ali had 21 dollars.  Leila gave him half of her $100, which is 100 / 2 = 50. 50 dollars.  So, Ali now has 21 + 50 = 71.  The answer is 71. 
[EXP] 68: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles.  Each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. 6 x 8 is 48, so there are 48 cupcakes that can be decorated.  Each pan holds 12 cupcakes, so she needs to bake pans to use up all the cupcakes.  48 / 12 is 4 pans.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 69: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Sarah spent 300 dollars on books.  Each book costs 15 dollars.  So, she bought 300 / 15 = 20 books.  Since she gave the same number of books to her 4 kids, each child got 20 / 4 = 5 books.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 70: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Gabriel has 20 songs.  Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so Luri has 20 x 3 = 60 songs.  Since both players can store 100 songs, Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs.   Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 songs.  To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add, you can subtract.  80 - 40 is 40.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 71: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  An 8-year-old child wants to buy a toy car which costs 12 dollars.  He already has 4 dollars.   So, the remaining amount he needs to save is 12 - 4 = 8 dollars.  He promises to save 2 dollars daily from his allowance.  To find out how many days it will take to save 8 dollars, we need to divide 8 by 2. 8 ÷ 2 = 4  So it will take him 4 days.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 72: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 112, [output]:  Paul is driving car twice a day for 14 days, so he has 14 x 2 = 28 rides in total.  Each morning ride is 6 dollars and each afternoon ride is 2 dollars.  So he spent 6 x 14 + 2 x 14 dollars.  6 x 14 is 84 and 2 x 14 is 28.  So he spent 84 + 28 dollars in total.   The answer is 112. 
[EXP] 73: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Suzie paid $7 in all.  She bought four packs of gum: 2 packs of strawberry, 1 pack of grape, and 1 pack of green apple.  The price of the grape gum is $2, and the price of the green apple gum is half that price, or $1. 

Let the cost of each strawberry pack be x.  Then the total amount she paid is:
2x + 2 + 1 = 7

To solve for x, first combine the terms on the left:
2x + 3 = 7

Subtract 3 from both sides:
2x = 4

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 2

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 74: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 110, [output]:  Gerald earns $30 per day.  He worked for 7 days, so he earned 30 x 7 = 210 dollars.  He spent $100, so he has 210 - 100 = 110 left.  The answer is 110. 
[EXP] 75: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]:  Ali has 4 ten-dollar bills which is 4 x 10 = 40 dollars.  He also has 6 twenty-dollar bills which is 6 x 20 = 120 dollars.   So he has a total of 40 + 120 = 160 dollars.  Then he gives 160 / 2 = 80 dollars to his sister.  This leaves him with 160 - 80 = 80 dollars.    He uses 3/5 * 80 = 48 dollars to buy dinner.  So he has 80 - 48 dollars left.  80 - 48 is 32.   The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 76: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 12, [output]: 27 cups of raisins were in the bag. 1 batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 cup of raisins.  So to find the number of batches of oatmeal cookies, we find out how many times 3/4 goes into 27. 27 x 1 = 27.  27 ÷ 3 is 9, and 9 ÷ 4 is 2. 2.  1.   But 1 is not what we want.  In order to find the number of batches of oatmeal cookies we can make from the bag of raisins, we need to know how many times 3/4 goes into 27.  So, since the correct number goes after the decimal point, we should convert 3/4 to a decimal. 3/4 = . 75.  27 ÷ . 75 is 36, so we can make 36 ÷ 4 = 9 batches of oatmeal cookies.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 77: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Jame is 27 - 5 = 22 years old now.  In 8 years, Jame will be 27 + 8 = 35 years old.  His cousin's age will be 35 - 5 = 30 in 8 years.  The cousin's age now is 30 - 8 = 22 years old.   The difference in their ages now is 22 - 22 = 0.  The answer is 0. 
[EXP] 78: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 35, [output]:  Since we have to pay an additional 20% on the $50 dinner bill, we need to find 20% of $50 first.  20% of $50 is $10.  So, the total bill including the tip will be $50 + $10 = $60.  The check is to be split between us, so I will pay half of it.  Half of $60 is $30.  The answer is $30. 
[EXP] 79: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 130, [output]:  LET'S BREAK THIS DOWN!

1.  Elise writes the alphabet TWICE.  That is 26 letters each time.   So, 26 + 26 = 52 letters. 52 letters so far. 52
2.   Then, Elise writes HALF the alphabet, which is 13 letters. 52 + 13 = 65 letters so far. 65
3.    Finally, Elise re-writes everything she has already written.  That means she writes the 52 letters again,  and the 13 letters again.  52 + 52 + 13 = 117

Elise has written 117 letters in total.  The answer is 117. 
[EXP] 80: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 92, [output]:  Bill has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, making 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.  He wants 2 bottles for each of 70 guests, making it 70 x 2 = 140 bottles.  In total, he has 140 - 48 = 92 bottles.  The answer is 92. 
[EXP] 81: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]: 3 cages have 10 hamsters.  So in total, 3 x 10 = 30 hamsters. 3 cages have 5 guinea pigs.  So in total, 3 x 5 = 15 guinea pigs.  To find the total number of rodents, add the hamsters and guinea pigs: 30 + 15 = 45.  The answer is 45. 
[EXP] 82: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Sharon started with 5 dollars.  The tooth fairy gave her 1 dollar for each of the next 3 teeth, which is 3 more dollars.  So she has 5 + 3 = 8 dollars.   Then the tooth fairy gave her half the amount for each of the next 2 teeth as she had received for each of the previous 3 teeth.  This means that for each of the last 2 teeth, the tooth fairy gave her half a dollar, since the previous 3 teeth were each worth 1 dollar.   So for the last 2 teeth, she got 2 half-dollars, which is 1 more dollar.  So the total money she has is 8 + 1 = 9 dollars.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 83: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 37, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

First, let's calculate the cost of bread: Each loaf of bread makes 10 sandwiches, and they buy it for $3. 10 times 3 is 30, so the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $30.  

Next, let's calculate the cost of other stuff (cheese and condiments): They spend $30 for 10 sandwiches.  So that's $30 / 10 = $3 per sandwich.  

Now let's calculate the revenue: They sell 10 sandwiches for $7 each. 7 x 10 is 70. 

Finally, let's calculate the profit: 
Revenue - Cost = Profit
70 - (30 + 30) = 70 - 60 = 10

The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 84: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 215, [output]:  The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.  1 hour = 60 minutes.  60 + 30 = 90.  The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.  2 hours = 2 x 60 = 120.  120 + 5 = 125.  The total length is 90 + 125 = 215.  The answer is 215. 
[EXP] 85: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 52, [output]:  Jared's speed started at 47 WPM.  Then it increased to 52 WPM.  Now it will increase by 5 more, to 52 + 5 = 57.  The three measurements are 47, 52, and 57.   To find the average, we add the three numbers and divide by 3.  The sum is 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.   156 divided by 3 is 52.  The answer is 52. 
[EXP] 86: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Let's call Jerry's current age "x".  Five years ago, Jerry would have been x - 5 years old.  According to the problem, Jerry is currently twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

We can solve this equation for x:

x = 2x - 10
x + 10 = 2x
10 = x

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.  Three years from now, Jerry will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old.  The answer is 13.

The answer is 17. 
[EXP] 93: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 29, [output]:  First, let's figure out how old Steve's wife is.  She is 4 years older than him, so she is 60 + 4 = 64.  Steve's son is currently half as old as his mom, so that means Steve's son is 64 / 2 = 32.   Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than him, so she is 32 - 3 = 29.  The answer is 29. 
[EXP] 94: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2100, [output]:  Ariadne's sales from red hats were 400 dollars in the first month, which is half of what she earned from selling green hats.  So she earned 400 x 2 = 800 dollars from green hats.  The total amount she earned in the first month is 800 + 400 = 1200 dollars. 

In the second month, she earned 3/4 of the amount she earned in the first month. 3/4 * 1200 = 900.  So she earned 900 dollars in the second month.  The total amount she made in two months is 1200 + 900 = 2100.  The answer is 2100. 
[EXP] 95: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Let's start by finding how long it took to cook pork.  Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, and it took 30 minutes to cook rice, it took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.  It took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice to cook beans, so 50 + 30 / 2 = 50 + 15 = 65 minutes.   To find the total time, add the time it took to cook each food: 30 + 50 + 65 = 145.  The answer is 145 minutes. 
[EXP] 96: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 360, [output]: 150 teachers are in total. 60% of 150 are history teachers.  60% of 150 is 90 history teachers. 150 - 90 is 60 math teachers.  60 math teachers will each sleep for 6 hours a day. 60 x 6 is 360 hours.  The answer is 360. 
[EXP] 97: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  There were originally 30 days of moods in total. 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral.  Neutral days is 30 - (12 + 8) = 10.  The first 8 days were good, the 2nd 8 days were bad, and the 3rd 8 days were neutral.  So 24 days are already accounted for.  The next 3 days are good, neutral, good.  So the last 3 days are counted.   In total, 12 + 3 = 15 good days.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 98: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 576, [output]: 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.  To find the number of hash browns one potato makes, we can divide 36 by 6, which is 6 hash browns per potato.  Now, if there are 96 potatoes, we can multiply the number of hash browns per potato by the number of potatoes. 6 * 96 = 576.  The answer is 576. 
[EXP] 99: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Greta baked 30 cookies.  Celinda baked twice as many, so she baked 2 x 30 = 60.  In total, they baked 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.  After eating 10 cookies, they were left with 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 100: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 68, [output]:  Firstly, we know that there are 14 red squares. 4 more blue squares than red squares means there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.  6 more green squares than blue squares means there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.  Finally, 12 fewer white squares than green squares means there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.  The total number of squares is 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68.  Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area in square feet is 68 x 1 x 1 = 68.  The answer is 68. 
[EXP] 101: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 135, [output]: 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each will be 15 x 20 = 300 fireworks.  This is the total number of fireworks. 40% of 300 is 40/100 x 300 = 120.  Hannah can see 120 fireworks.  Hannah's backyard fireworks will be 3 boxes of 5 each, so 3 * 5 = 15.  The total number of fireworks Hannah can see will be the 120 she can see from her view and the 15 she is setting off, so 120 + 15 = 135.  The answer is 135. 
[EXP] 102: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 40% of the water from the Colorado River is used by the city. 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes.  That means the remaining 20% is used for non-industrial purposes.  Since 40% is used by the city overall, the percent used for non-industrial purposes is 20% of 40%.  To find 20% of 40%, we do 20/100 x 40/100 = 8%.  The answer is 8%. 
[EXP] 103: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 1.  First, let's calculate how much it cost James to pick blueberries.  He paid $20 to go, and then another $1. 5 per pound.  To find the total cost, we need to multiply 1. 5 by 30, since he picked 30 pounds.  1. 5 * 30 is 45.   So the total cost was 20 + 45 = 65. 2.   Now let's calculate how much it would have cost him to buy the same amount at the store.  At $2.  5 per pound, the total cost would be 2.  5 * 30 = 75.   Therefore, he saved 75 - 65 = 10 dollars by picking blueberries instead of buying at the store.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 104: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2450, [output]:  Helga can dance 5 minutes in total, and 2 minutes with arms raised.  So the total time with arms down is 5 - 2 = 3 minutes.  When arms are down, she taps both feet at a rate of 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.   So in 3 minutes, she will have tapped both feet 3 * 550 = 1650 times.  When her arms are up, she taps both feet at a rate of 200 taps per minute.  Therefore, in 2 minutes she will have tapped both feet 2 * 200 = 400 times.  In total, she will have tapped both feet 1650 + 400 = 2050 times.  The answer is 2050. 
[EXP] 105: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]: 15 + 45 = 60.  60 + 40 + 50 = 150. 60 / 150 = 0. 4 or 40%.  The answer is 40%. 
[EXP] 106: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 20% of 100 voters is 20.  Since candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A, candidate B got 20 + (20 x 0. 50) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.  Since there are a total of 100 voters, candidate C got 100 - 20 - 30 = 50 votes.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 107: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]: 2 classes have the same number of students, so we can let x be the number of students in each class.  Then, 2x = 80, so x = 40.  Each class has 40 students.  40% of students in each class are girls.   In other words, 40% of 40 is 16 girls in each class.  To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total: 40 - 16 = 24.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 108: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 3, [output]: 54 students need to be separated into 6 groups of equal size.  So each group has 54/6 = 9 students.  But we need to split them into 12 groups, not 6.   So we need to add 12 - 6 = 6 more groups.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 109: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]: 33 people are in this council.  Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against, let's do this step by step:

1.  Let the number of votes against be x.  Then the number of votes in favor is 2x.  These form a total of the votes: x + 2x = 3x. 
2.  But we know that the total of the votes is 33.  So x + 2x = 33.  x = 11, so that means twice as many votes in favor than against.   Then we find the number of votes in favor with 2x = 2*11 = 22 votes.  The answer is 22. 
[EXP] 110: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, we can let x be the amount of cases of shingles needed by the second house.  Then the first house will need 1/2x cases, and the third house will need 2*(1/2x) or x cases. 

We know that the total amount of shingles is 250 cases.  So we can set up the equation:

1/2x + x + x = 250

Combining like terms, we get:

3/2x = 250

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2/3:

x = (2/3)*250

x = 167

So the second house needs 167 cases of shingles.  The first house needs 1/2 of that, which is 167/2 = 83. 3 cases.  The third house, which needs double the first house, will need 2*83 = 166 cases.  The answer is 166. 
[EXP] 111: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  There are 4 vanilla scents originally.  Then 5 of each are sold.  5 * 4 = 20 vanilla scents sold.  There were 8 fruity scents originally.   Then 2 of each are sold. 2 * 8 = 16 fruity scents sold.   So, more vanilla scents sold compared with fruity scents is 20 - 16 = 4.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 112: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 4400, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Mike has 600 movies. 1/3 of his movies are in various series.  So 1/3 * 600 is 200 movies.  For these 200 movies, he only needs to buy the series and save $6 per movie.  He won't have to buy 200 movies individually, and instead will only pay for the series. 

The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400 movies.  40% of these are older movies, which are $5.   40% of 400 is 40/100 * 400 = 160 movies.  For these 160 movies, he pays $5 each, so that's 160 * 5 = 800 dollars.  The remaining movies are 400 - 160 = 240 movies.   These movies are the normal $10 each.  The cost for these 240 movies is 240 * 10 = 2400 dollars.  

The total cost is the cost of the series movies ($0) and the cost of the older movies ($800) and the cost of the normal movies ($2400).  So the cost is $0 + $800 + $2400 = $3200.  The answer is 3200. 
[EXP] 113: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 10 MPG means that the car uses 1/10 of a gallon per mile it travels.  So to calculate how many gallons the car uses per day, we find out how many miles the car travels per day and then divide that by 10.  The driving distance from home to office and back is 5 + 5 = 10 miles per day, so the car uses 10 miles per day divided by 10, which is 10/10 = 1 gallon of gas per day.  Since Andy uses his car 5 days a week, he uses 1 x 5 = 5 gallons of gas per week.  At a price of $3/gallon, 5 gallons of gas costs 5 x $3 = $15.  The answer is $15. 
[EXP] 114: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]: 172 people are on the train initially.  At the first stop, 47 people get off, leaving 172 - 47 = 125 people.  Then 13 people get on, so 125 + 13 = 138 people.  At the next stop, 38 people get off.  138 - 38 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 115: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Billy started with 10 dollars per hour. 2 months later, his pay became 10 + 0. 50 = 10. 50 per hour.  Then, on his anniversary, he got another raise to 10. 50 + 1. 00 = 11.  50 per hour.  Billy works 20 hours.   He earns 20 x 11.  50 = 230.  Sally starts with 10 + 0. 50 = 10.  50 per hour.  She also works 20 hours.   She earns 20 x 10.  50 = 200.   The difference is 230 - 200 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 116: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1170, [output]: 600 + 300 = 900.  He pays a premium of 30%. 30% of 900 is 30% x 900 = 0. 30 x 900 = 270.  So he paid 900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
[EXP] 117: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 79, [output]:  Rose starts by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each.  So she picks 3 x 5 = 15 petals.  Then she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.   So that is 4 x 6 = 24 petals.  Next she adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  So that is 5 x 4 = 20 petals.  Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each.   So that is 6 x 7 = 42 petals.  Altogether she picks 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 petals.   15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.  But then the wind blows 1 of each flower, or 7 in total, and she loses them.  So she is left with 101 - 7 = 94 petals.   The answer is 94. 
[EXP] 118: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6,250, [output]: 175,000 dollars were raised.  50,000 dollars came from organizations, so the students must have raised 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 dollars.  The 20 students raised 125,000 dollars as a group.  To find how much each student raised, we divide 125,000 by 20.  125,000 ÷ 20 is 6,250.  The answer is 6,250 dollars. 
[EXP] 119: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the number of eggs of each color:

* Green eggs: Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
* Blue eggs: Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs. 10 blue eggs.  * Pink eggs: Cindy had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. 9 pink eggs.  * Yellow eggs: Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so 9 ÷ 3 = 3 yellow eggs. 3 yellow eggs.   Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs Cindy has: 5 green eggs + 10 blue eggs + 9 pink eggs + 3 yellow eggs = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.  The answer is 27. 
[EXP] 120: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than that, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches.  Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 x 12 = 48 inches.  Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 x 48 = 480 inches.   To convert this to feet, 480 inches = 480/12 = 40 feet.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 121: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's calculate the total used glue for each stick: 

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which means 5/6 is used. 5/6 of 12mm is 10mm. 
The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which means 1/3 is used. 1/3 of 12mm is 4mm.  
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which means 1/2 is used. 1/2 of 12mm is 6mm. 

To find the total length of the used glue, add the used length of each glue stick: 10mm + 4mm + 6mm = 20mm.  The total length of the unused glue is the total length of the glue stick minus the used glue, which is 12mm - 20mm = -8mm.  So, the total length of the used glue would be the absolute value of -8mm, which is 8mm.  But we have to consider that the problem is asking for the unused glue, which is 12mm - 8mm = 4mm.   The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 122: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 975, [output]: 300 dollars were invested at a rate of 0. 75 * 300 = 225.  This is the interest rate.  So each year, Brenda will have $225 more.  Three years will be 225 * 3 = 675 dollars in interest.  The total will be the original 300 dollars plus the interest 300 + 675 = 975.   The answer is 975. 
[EXP] 123: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 144, [output]:  In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.  In the next year, they will build 12 * 3 = 36 homes.  After doubling this amount in the third year, that will be 36 * 2 = 72 homes.   Adding 12 + 36 + 72 gives 120 homes.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 124: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in 12 months, Claire earns 12 badges.  Amber earns half the amount of badges as Claire in the same amount of time, so Amber earns 12 / 2 = 6 badges.   Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 12 x 3 = 36 badges.  Therefore, Wendy earns 36 - 6 = 30 more badges than Amber.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 125: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  This problem can be solved by first finding out how many jello cups are needed in total.  30 kids and each kid can have 4 jello cups, that means 30 x 4 = 120 jello cups.  Since each box of jello makes 10 small jello cups, Greg needs 120 / 10 = 12 boxes of jello.   Since each box costs 1. 25 dollars, the total cost will be 12 * 1. 25 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 126: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  Paul started with 52 marbles.  He then received 28 more marbles, for a total of 52 + 28 = 80.  Then he lost 1/4 of his marbles. 1/4 of 80 is 20.  So he lost 20 marbles. 80 - 20 is 60.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 127: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 1.  The cost of the 5 packs of bacon is $10. 2 packets of chicken each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon, so they cost 2 * 2 = 4 dollars each. 6 packets of chicken will cost 6 * 4 = 24 dollars.  3 packs of strawberries cost 3 * 4 = 12 dollars. 7 packs of apples each cost half of the strawberries, so half of 4 dollars, which is 2 dollars. 7 packs of apples will cost 7 * 2 = 14 dollars.  The total cost of all the items is 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 dollars.  Kelly's budget is 65 dollars.  After buying everything, she will have 65 - 60 = 5 dollars left.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 128: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Joelle has 5 orchids. 5 orchids x 5 petals each = 25 petals.  She has 4 African daisies. 4 daisies x 10 petals each = 40 petals.  Daisies have 40 petals, orchids have 25.  40 - 25 is 15.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 129: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 250, [output]: 10 * 3 = 30. 30 * 25 = 750.  750 - 500 = 250.  John made a profit of 250 dollars.  The answer is 250. 
[EXP] 130: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's break it down:

For small masks:
Jo needs 2 yards of material for 4 masks, so for 20 masks, she would need:
20/4 = 5 times as many masks, which means she needs 2 x 5 = 10 yards of material. 

For large masks:
Jo needs 2. 25 yards of material for 3 masks, so for 8 masks, she would need:
2. 25 / 3 = 0. 833.  (approximately 0. 83) times as many material, which means she needs 0.  83 x 2. 25 = 2 yards of material.  But she needs it for 8 large masks, so it would be:
2 x 8 = 16 yards of material.  So, in total, she would need 10 + 16 = 26 yards of material.  The answer is 26. 
[EXP] 131: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 700, [output]:  Farmer Brown's farm has 200 acres.  Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice this.  Twice 200 is 400, and 400 + 100 is 500.  So Farmer Smith's farm has 500 acres.  To find the total of both farms, we need to add 200 and 500: 200 + 500 = 700 acres.   The answer is 700. 
[EXP] 132: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Let's first find the total number of pieces of fruit Kira bought. 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 pieces of fruit.  Then Lola ate 2 pieces.  14 - 2 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 133: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 12, [output]: 24 berries were to be collected in 8 hours.  In one trip, the sloth can pick up an unknown number of berries in 4 hours.  (4/8) = (1/2).   To get to 24 berries in 8 hours, we can multiply this fraction by 6 to get 6 berries per trip.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Paul is 10 years older than John and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.  Let John's age be x.  Then Paul's age is x + 10.  We know that the sum of their ages is 100 and is also equal to Peter's age.   So,

x + (x + 10) + x = 100

We can combine the x's and simplify:

3x + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

3x = 90

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 30

So John's age is 30 and Paul's age is 40 (30 + 10).  According to the information given, Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:

Peter's age = Paul's age + John's age
= 40 + 30
= 70

The answer is 70. 
[EXP] 135: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  John earned 50 x 6 = 300 dollars.  He spent 50 dollars on gas, leaving him with 300 - 50 = 250 dollars.  He also wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he will spend that 100 dollars.   After that, he will have 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left.  He can buy 150 ÷ 25 = 6 pens with what he has left.  He also needs 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, which will cost 5 x 10 = 50 dollars.  After buying those pencils, he will be left with 150 - 50 = 100.   So he will be able to buy 100 ÷ 25 = 4 pens.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 136: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]:  First, James swims 60% of 20 miles which is 0. 6 x 20 = 12 miles.  Then he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, so he took 12 / 2 = 6 hours to swim 12 miles.  Then he rests for half of this time, i.  e. , 6 / 2 = 3 hours.  After resting he swims the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles.   His new pace is half of 2 miles per hour, which is 1 mile per hour.  So it took him 8 / 1 = 8 hours to swim the remaining distance.   In total, it took James 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours to get across the lake.  The answer is 17. 
[EXP] 137: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 360, [output]: 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is a period of 15 hours. 15 hours is the same as 15 * 60 minutes, or 900 minutes.  Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, he staples 2 reports per minute. 2 * 900 = 1800 reports.  The answer is 1800 reports. 
[EXP] 138: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Let's start with the information given.  We know that Jason picked up and carried 2 balls, and that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason.   So Jordan carried 2 x 2 = 4 balls.  Jeffrey carried half as many balls as Jason, so Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.   The total number of balls carried is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 balls.  So Jason, Jordan, and Jeffrey carried a total of 7 balls.   We need to find the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice.  We know that the coach brought a bag, and after the practice, the bag was filled evenly with the balls that the coach brought.  If the coach brought two different bags, the bag would be empty or not even close to being filled.  So, the coach brought one big bag filled with all the balls and dumped them onto the gym floor.   So, after the three boys picked up the balls and carried them over to the bag, the bag was full.  The bag can now be used as the set.    Each boy carried a ball.  So, 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 balls were carried by the boys.   The remainder of the balls in the bag is 3 + 7 = 10 balls.  So, 10 balls is equal to the total number of balls in the bag.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 139: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Greta started with one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.  She was given 1/2 a dozen brownies at her office party, which is 6 brownies. 1/2 dozen = 6. 

Then she came home to 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies. 48 + 12 + 6 = 66 brownies that Greta had in total. 

Then, during her party at home, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. 1 1/2 dozen = 18 brownies.   So, Greta had 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left.  The answer is 48. 
[EXP] 140: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 79, [output]:  There are 50 states in the USA.  So, half of the number of states in the USA is 50 / 2 = 25.  Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.   
In total, there are 50 states in the USA and 29 states in India.  50 + 29 = 79.  The answer is 79. 
[EXP] 141: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]:  Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.  Her sister gave her 10 more than her mother, which is 20 + 10 = 30.  Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, which is 2 x 20 = 40.   Altogether, Adrianne has 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.  The answer is 90. 
[EXP] 142: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 30 pounds of soil are available. 4 sunflowers need 4 x 3 = 12 pounds of soil. 10 carnations need 10 x 1. 5 = 15 pounds of soil. 12 + 15 = 27 pounds of soil used. 30 - 27 = 3 pounds of soil left.  Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so 3/1 = 3 roses can be planted.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 143: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  To find the length of Chikote's howl, we need to multiply Tobias' howl by 2, because Chikote howls for twice as long.  So Chikote's howl is 20 * 2 = 40 seconds.  Now we need to find the length of Igneous' howl.   Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so we add the length of their howls: 20 + 40 = 60.  So Igneous' howl is 60 seconds.  Finally, we add the lengths of all three howls to find the combined length of their howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.   To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60, because 1 minute is 60 seconds.  120 seconds / 60 is 2.  So the combined length of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 144: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 20 minutes for the batter and 30 minutes to bake the cake are 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.  Then it takes 2 hours to cool the cake. 2 hours is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.   Adding that to the time it takes to make the batter and bake the cake, you get 50 + 120 = 170 minutes.  Then, it takes 10 more minutes to frost the cake, so the total amount of time it takes is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.   There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 180 minutes is 180 / 60 = 3 hours.  So it will take a total of 3 hours.   Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, so the latest she can start making the cake is at 2:00 pm.  The answer is 2:00 pm. 
[EXP] 145: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 230, [output]:  First, we need to calculate how many miles Matteo traveled. 55 miles per hour for 4 hours is:

55 * 4 = 220 miles

Then, we calculate how many miles Shandy traveled:

45 miles per hour for 10 hours is:

45 * 10 = 450 miles

Now, we find the difference in distance:

450 - 220 = 230 miles

So Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.  The answer is 230. 
[EXP] 146: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 78, [output]: 15 packs of sweets, with 60 pieces in each pack, is a total of 15 x 60 = 900 pieces.  Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave the rest to her friends. 900 - 120 (2 packs) = 780. 780 pieces of sweets were given to Anne's 10 friends.  780 / 10 = 78.  Each friend received 78 sweets.  The answer is 78. 
[EXP] 147: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.  Let's call the number of large stuffed animals sold x.  Then the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x. 

The text says that Teresa earned $120 from the sales.  The cost for a small stuffed animal is $4, and the cost for a large stuffed animal is 3 times that, or $12.   So Teresa earned $4 x 2x = 8x for the small stuffed animals and $12x for the large stuffed animals.  Total earnings will be 8x + 12x = 20x.   The text says the total earnings are $120, so we can set up an equation: 

20x = 120

To solve for x, we can divide by 20: 

x = 120 / 20

x = 6

So Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals and 2x = 2(6) = 12 small stuffed animals.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 148: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]:  Sally started with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons. 25 * 40% is 10 red balloons burst, so she has 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.  
She had 12 yellow balloons, and accidentally released half, so she had 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons left. 8 blue balloons were caught, and she added 75% of them, which is 0. 75 * 8 = 6, so she added 6 blue balloons.  15 red, 7 green, 6 yellow, and 6 blue balloons make a total of 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 balloons.  The answer is 34. 
[EXP] 149: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 40 apples are in one box. 2 boxes will have 40 + 40 = 80 apples. 8 apples in one pack. 80 divided by 8 is 10.  The answer is 10.

[EXP] 151: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 655, [output]: 1955 is the total distance Bernice needs to travel.  She has already driven 325 kilometers for 4 days, so that is 4 x 325 = 1300 kilometers.  To find how much she still needs to drive, we subtract 1300 from 1955.  1955 - 1300 is 655.  The answer is 655. 
[EXP] 152: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]: 1.  On Saturday, Jill and her friends watch 4 movies. 2.  On a Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4/2 = 2 movies.  So, a weekend they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.   Now, every weekend, they will watch 6 movies.  So, in 4 weeks, they will watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.   The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 153: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 247, [output]: 32 classes visited on Monday.  On Tuesday, twice as many visited. 32 x 2 = 64.  On Wednesday, three times as many visited as on Monday. 32 x 3 = 96.   On Thursday, 30 classes visited.  On Friday, 25 classes visited.   To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, add all these numbers together: 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25. 32 + 64 is 96. 96 + 96 is 192. 192 + 30 is 222.  222 + 25 is 247.  The answer is 247. 
[EXP] 154: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 251, [output]:  The total number of guests is 25 classmates + 7 dance classmates + 13 family members = 45 guests.  There are 4 people who couldn't come, so the actual number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.  The cost to rent the theater is $125 for 20 people, and $6 for each additional person.  To find the number of people extra, we subtract 20 from 41: 41 - 20 = 21.  The cost for these extra guests is 21 x $6 = $126.  So, the total cost is the cost for the theater, plus the cost for the extra guests: $125 + $126 = $251.   The answer is $251. 
[EXP] 155: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Melanie started saving toothpicks 12 weeks ago and has saved 10 toothpicks each week.  So she already has 10 x 12 = 120 toothpicks. 200 toothpicks minus 120 toothpicks leaves 200 - 120 = 80.   Melanie needs 80 more toothpicks.  She saves 10 toothpicks each week, so 80/10 = 8 weeks until she collects 200 toothpicks.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 156: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]:  The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years.  To find out how many inches it grows in 1 year, we can divide 8 by 4. 8/4 = 2.  So the crocodile grows 2 inches per year.  Now, we can multiply the inches it grows per year times 13 years.  2 * 13 = 26.  The answer is 26. 
[EXP] 157: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1080, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step.  The T-Rex ate half of the small triceratops, leaving half remaining.  Then, the velociraptors ate half of what was left, which was a quarter of the original triceratops.  So, we know that the velociraptors ate a quarter of the original triceratops.   Finally, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which is the remaining quarter.  Therefore, the total amount of meat the triceratops had was 4 times the amount the Allosaurus ate. 4 x 270 = 1080.  The answer is 1080. 
[EXP] 158: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Let's first find the time it takes to ride the biggest waterslide:

[EXP] 161: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 560, [output]:  John visits his parents twice a month.  So each month he makes a round trip twice.  Each trip takes him 2 hours, and considering the speed, we calculate the total distance as round trip distance = total time * total speed, or 4 hours * 70 mph = 280 miles.  For 2 trips, that's 2 x 280 = 560 miles.  The answer is 560. 
[EXP] 162: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 750, [output]: 


Let's start by figuring out how fast the 2nd fastest car goes.  We know it's 5 times faster than the average car, which is 120 Miles per hour.  So the 2nd fastest car drives 5 x 120 = 600 Miles per hour. 

Now we know the 2nd fastest car goes 600 mph.  We know the fastest car is 1. 25 times faster.  So it goes 1. 25 * 600 = 750 mph.  The answer is 750 mph. 
[EXP] 163: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Jane started with 0 dollars. 4 x 8 = 32. 32 dollars saved so far.  Since she wants 60 dollars, she needs 60 - 32 = 28 dollars more. 28 / 4 = 7 weeks more.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 164: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 3 eggs a day for 30 days is 3 x 30 = 90 eggs.  Then he eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days, which is 5 x 30 = 150 eggs. 90 + 150 is 240 eggs.  To find the number of dozen eggs, divide the total number of eggs by 12. 240 / 12 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 165: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]: 3 dozen eggs means 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.  If there are 4 children, and each gets the same number of eggs, then we divide the total number of eggs by 4. 36 / 4 = 9.  So each child gets 9 eggs.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 166: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 13, [output]: 5 minutes is the time it takes to play the first song.  The second song is 60% longer, so you add 60% of 5 minutes to the time it takes to play the first song.  60% of 5 is 3, so it takes 3 minutes longer to play the second song.   5 minutes plus 3 minutes is 8 minutes.  The total time is 8 minutes.  The answer is 8 minutes. 
[EXP] 167: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  If Haley is 26, then half her age is 26/2 = 13.  Geb is 10 less than that, so Geb is 13 - 10 = 3.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 168: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Ronnie was given 5 dollars.  Rissa was given thrice as much, which is 5 * 3 = 15 dollars.  They both gave an equal amount of money to their little sister.   Let's say they each gave x dollars.  Then 5 - x is the amount of money Ronnie will have and 15 - x is the amount of money Rissa will have.  We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money.  So  (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.   Simplifying, we get 15 - x = 12, so x = 3.  So Ronnie gave 3 dollars to his little sister.  He started with 5 dollars, so he is left with 5 - 3 = 2 dollars. 
 
The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 169: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.  20% of 5 is 1 inch, so the teacher can use 5 - 1 = 4 inches before needing to recycle the chalk.  Since he used 45% on monday, that means he used 5 x 0. 45 = 2. 25 inches on monday.  So he has 4 - 2. 25 = 1.  75 inches left.  Since he uses 1 inch of chalk per day at 20% use, the teacher has 1. 75 days before he needs to recycle this piece.  The answer is 1. 
[EXP] 170: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 11, [output]: 2 apples initially fell out of the tree.  Newton picked up the 2 apples, so he has 2 apples now.  He puts 1 apple in his pocket, so he has 2 - 1 = 1 apple left.   Then he throws the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.  He picks up these apples, so now he has 1 + 5 = 6 apples.  He puts all but one in his pocket, so he has 6 - 1 = 5 apples left.   Then he throws the remaining apple into the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out.  He picks up all remaining apples, so now he has 5 + 6 = 11 apples in total.   He goes home with these apples.  The answer is 11. 
[EXP] 171: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 19, [output]: 78 bandages were left after 3 days.  On the last day, they had half a pack of bandages left. 1 pack of bandages is 50 bandages.  Half a pack is 25 bandages.  Therefore, they used 50 - 25 = 25 bandages on the last day.  On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day.   On the first day, they used 38 bandages, so the second day they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.  Therefore, total bandages used over the 3 days are 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 bandages.  This is in addition to the three bulk packs of bandages they ordered (one on the first day and two on the third day).   Three bulk packs is 3 x 50 = 150 bandages.  Therefore, they started with 91 + 150 = 241 bandages originally.  The answer is 241. 
[EXP] 172: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2400, [output]:  First, let's figure out the cost of the scotch. 10 bottles for 600 dollars means each bottle cost 600 / 10 = 60 dollars.  He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so 20 bottles.  The cognac costs 50% more than scotch, which is 90 dollars.  So 20 * 90 = 1800, and in total he spends 1800 + 600 = 2400.  The answer is 2400.

If we have enough medicine for one dose of each, that is 14 + 42 = 56 mL of medicine for one dose.   For 8 doses, it would be 8 * 56 = 448 mL of medicine.  The answer is 448. 
[EXP] 175: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 225, [output]: 10 students per grade, 4-7 grade levels.  So there are 4 x 10 = 40 students total that can enter the escape room competition.  But, only 8 students can enter at a time.  So we need to find out how many groups we can make of 8 students.  40 / 8 = 5.  It will take 5 groups of 8 students to have all 40 students try the escape room.  For each group, it takes 45 minutes.   So in total, it will take 5 x 45 minutes = 225 minutes.  The answer is 225. 
[EXP] 176: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Let's start by saying that x is the number of cupcakes Carly made. 3x - 2 is the number of brownies she made, because she makes 3 times as many brownies as cupcakes and then 2 less.  If each person gets 2 treats, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.  If there were 10 treats, then (x) + (3x - 2) = 10.  To solve, we can combine like terms and get 4x - 2 = 10.  Now, we can add 2 to both sides to get 4x = 12.   Finally, to find x, we can divide both sides by 4 and get x = 3.  The answer is 3.
