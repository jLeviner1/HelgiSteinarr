[EXP] 40: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 315, [output]: 1800 is the total number of stitches in the sweater. Since there are 2 sleeves, which we are looking for, and 1 collar and 1 rosette, we can set up the equation:

Body + Collar + Rosette = 1800

Body = 900

Collar = 900 / 10 = 90

Rosette = 2 x 90 = 180

Now we can set up an equation to find the total number of stitches for the 2 sleeves:

900 + 90 + 180 = 1170

So, the total number of stitches for the 2 sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630.

Therefore, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches. The answer is 315.

Explanation: Let's think about it like the previous examples. Imagine you have a piece of paper and you fold it in half vertically, then you open it back up. You now have two pieces of paper (the front and the back). Then, page 1 is printed on the left back, page 2 is printed on the left front. This means that the back and the front of one piece of paper were used for pages 1 and 2. 

For 32 pages, you will need the front and back of the first and second pieces of paper to print pages 1-4 (1 on the left back, 2 on the left front, 3 on the right back, 4 on the right front). Then for the next 16 pages, again you'll need the front and back of one piece of paper for each pair of pages (for example, pages 5 and 6 on one piece of paper, 7 and 8 on another, and so on). Then finally, pages 29 and 30 on the left back and front, and 31 and 32 on the right back and front. 

So for 32 pages, you will need the front and back of 16 pieces of paper, which means the total number of pieces of paper needed is 16 + 16 = 32.

To find the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog, we need to find the intersection of these two conditions. The number of candles that explode is 500.

The total cost per sandwich is the cost of the bread and the cheese and condiments, which is $0.30 + $3 = $3.30.

Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so let's call his current age "x". Five years ago, he would have been x - 5 years old. The problem states that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives:

-x = -10

Adding 10 to both sides gives:

[EXP] 100: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 68, [output]:  Let's start by using the information we're given:

* The comforter has 14 red squares.
* There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.
* There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.
* There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we need to find the total number of square feet. Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, we can multiply the number of squares by the area of a single square:

* 14 red squares = 14 x 1 x 1 = 14 square feet
* 18 blue squares = 18 x 1 x 1 = 18 square feet
* 24 green squares = 24 x 1 x 1 = 24 square feet
* 12 white squares = 12 x 1 x 1 = 12 square feet

Adding up all the square feet from each color:

14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Therefore, Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed is 250. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (1/2x) + 2x = 250

Combine like terms:

3.5x = 250

Divide both sides by 3.5:

x = 71.43

So House 1 needs 71.43 cases of shingles. Since House 3 needs double what House 1 needs, it will need 2 x 71.43 = 142.86 cases of shingles.

The answer is 142.86.

[EXP] 127: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Kelly’s budget is 65. First, let’s find the cost of the non-bacon items. The packs of chicken cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since the 5 packs of bacon cost 10 dollars, one pack of chicken costs 2 dollars. There are 6 packs of chicken, so they cost 2 * 6 = 12 dollars. The 3 packs of strawberries cost 4 dollars each, so they cost 3 x 4 = 12 dollars. The 7 packs of apples cost half the price of each strawberry pack, which is 2 dollars each, so they cost 7 x 2 = 14 dollars. Total cost for non-bacon items is 12 + 12 + 14 = 38 dollars.

[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, which means we can set up the equation:

Peter + Paul + Jean = 100

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so we can write:

Paul = Jean + 10

And we know that Peter's age is the sum of Paul and Jean's age, so we can write:

Peter = Paul + Jean

Now we can substitute the expression for Paul in terms of Jean into the equation for Peter:

Peter = (Jean + 10) + Jean

Combine like terms:

Peter = 2Jean + 10

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100, so we can set up the equation:

Peter + Paul + Jean = 100

Substitute the expressions we have for Peter and Paul:

(2Jean + 10) + (Jean + 10) + Jean = 100

Combine like terms:

4Jean + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4Jean = 80

Divide by 4:

Jean = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Peter's age using the equation:

Peter = 2Jean + 10
= 2(20) + 10
= 40 + 10
= 50

So, Peter is 50 years old. The answer is 50.

Each small stuffed animal costs 4 dollars, so the total revenue from small stuffed animals is 2x * 4 = 8x dollars.

The large stuffed animals are 3 times the price of small ones, so they cost 4 * 3 = 12 dollars each. The total revenue from large stuffed animals is x * 12 dollars.

The total revenue from both animals is $120, so we can set up the equation:

8x + x * 12 = 120

Combine like terms:

9x + 12x = 120

Combine the x terms:

20x = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 6

Since x is the number of large stuffed animals sold, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals.

Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x = 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

[EXP] 157: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1080, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step:

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the small triceratops, so half of the triceratops' original weight is gone.
2. The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, which means they took half of the remaining half. So, half of the remaining triceratops is gone.
3. The lazy Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that 270 kilograms is what was left after the velociraptors took their half.

Since the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kg, and that's half of what was left after the velociraptors took their half, the remaining triceratops (after the T-Rex) is twice 270 kg, which is 540 kg.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the original triceratops, the original triceratops weight is twice 540 kg, which is 1080 kg.

So, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

[EXP] 178: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 80 classrooms at 15 minutes each will take 80 x 15 = 1200 minutes. Since they have 5 days, that will take 1200 minutes / 5 = 240 minutes per day. Since they work 8 hour days, that is 8 x 60 = 480 minutes. So they spend 240 / 480 = 0.5, or 50% of their day cleaning classrooms per day.

Since there are 5 pigs, the total feed needed is 56 x 5 = 280 pounds. Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. So he has 300 - 280 = 20 pounds left.

[EXP] 188: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2280, [output]:  To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money raised by each girl and then add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra. Since Alexandra raises $430, we can find the amount Kim raises by adding 320 to 430: $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah. Since Sarah raises $300, we can find the amount Maryam raises by adding 400 to 300: $300 + $400 = $700.

To find the total amount of money they all raised, add up the amounts each girl raised: $750 + $430 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

The answer is 2180.
