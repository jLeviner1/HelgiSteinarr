[EXP] 2: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 160, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Carla starts downloading a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute.  The total time it would take to download the file is:
200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

Since she's 40% of the way through the download, or 0. 4 x 200 = 80 GB, she would have already downloaded 80 GB in 80 / 2 = 40 minutes. 
But then Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes.  So, 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes have passed. 
Now, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.  She still has 200 - 80 = 120 GB left to download.  The remaining time is:
120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes Carla to download the file is:
60 minutes (initial download) + 60 minutes (remaining download) = 120 minutes

Jam also has 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils.  So, we can set up the equation:

3x + 2 = 26

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 24

Then, we can divide both sides by 3 to find the number of pencils in each box:

x = 24/3
x = 8

So, Jam has 8 pencils in each box, and since she has 3 boxes, the total number of pencils Jam has is:

Adding the 2 loose pencils, Jam has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils.

Since he is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

To solve the equation, we can simplify it by distributing the 2:

x = 2x - 10

Then, we can add 10 to both sides to get:

x + 10 = 2x

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

[EXP] 110: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]: 250 is the total number of cases needed.  House 1 will need 1/2 of what House 2 will need.  Let's call House 2's requirement X.  Then House 1's requirement is X/2. 

House 3's requirement is double that of House 1, so it's 2*(X/2) = X. 

Since all three houses together need 250 cases, we can set up the equation:

(X/2) + X + 2*(X/2) = 250

Combine like terms:

3X/2 + X = 250

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

3X + 2X = 500

Combine like terms:

5X = 500

Divide both sides by 5:

X = 100

Now we know House 2 needs 100 cases.  House 1 needs 1/2 of that, which is 100/2 = 50.  House 3 needs double 50, which is 100.

2.  To find out how much fuel Andy consumes in a week, we can multiply the distance by his car's fuel efficiency (10 MPG).  50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons. 
3.  Since Andy consumes 5 gallons in a week, and the current price of gas is $3/gallon, we can multiply the number of gallons by the price to find out how much money his car is consuming per week.  5 gallons x $3/gallon = $15.

[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's call John's age "J".  Since Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul's age is J + 10.  The combined age is 100, so J + J + 10 + Peter's age equals 100. 

We know that Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age = J + (J + 10) = 2J + 10. 

Putting the two expressions together, we get:
J + J + 10 + 2J + 10 = 100

Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

So John's age is 20.  Paul's age is J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.  Since Peter's age is 2J + 10, Peter's age is 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50.

[EXP] 138: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Jason carried 2 balls. 
* Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. 
* Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason. 

Let's say the number of balls Jeffrey carried is x. 

Since Jason carries twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls. 

Since Jordan carries twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2(2x) = 4x balls. 

The total number of balls the boys picked up is the sum of the balls each of them carried:

2x + 2 + 4x = 6x + 2

The total number of balls the coach brought to practice is the number of balls the boys picked up, which is 6x + 2. 

However, we are not told the total number of balls, only that they are the same as the ones the coach brought initially.  So, we need to find the total number of balls the coach brought. 

Let's say the total number of balls the coach brought is n. 

The coach brought one bag filled with basketballs, so the coach brought n balls initially. 

The boys picked up all the balls in one trip, and they did so without any balls left over.  This means that the total number of balls the boys picked up is equal to the total number of balls the coach brought:

6x + 2 = n

Now, we can solve for n:

n = 6x + 2

But we also know that the coach brought n balls initially.  So, the coach brought n balls, and the boys picked up 6x + 2 balls, which is equal to n. 

From the initial problem, we know that the boys picked up:

12 balls (Jason + Jeffrey) + 4 balls (Jordan) = 16 balls

So, 6x + 2 = 16

Subtract 2 from both sides:

6x = 14

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 14/6
x = 7/3

Now that we have found x, we can find n:

n = 6x + 2
n = 6(7/3) + 2
n = 14 + 2
n = 16

The coach brought 16 balls initially.

Then, she sold twice as many small ones as large ones, so let's say she sold x large ones and 2x small ones.

[EXP] 157: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1080, [output]:  Let's start with what we know:

* The T-Rex found the triceratops and ate half of it, leaving half left. 
* The velociraptors came and ate half of what was left, which is half of half, or a quarter of the original. 
* The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which was the remaining quarter of the triceratops. 

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

 Let x be the original amount of meat on the triceratops. 

* T-Rex took half, leaving half: x / 2 = remaining meat
* Velociraptors took another half of that, leaving a quarter: (x / 2) / 2 = 270 kg
* Simplify the equation: x / 4 = 270

To solve for x, multiply both sides by 4:

x = 270 * 4

x = 1080

So, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate it.

First, the round trip, from John's home to his parents' home and back, takes 2 hours.  If it takes him 2 hours to drive at a speed of 70 mph, we can calculate the distance:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 * 2 = 140 miles

So the round trip distance is 140 miles. 

John visits his parents twice a month, so he does the round trip twice a month.  To find the total distance he drives in a month, we multiply the round trip distance by 2:

Total distance = Round trip distance * 2
Total distance = 140 * 2 = 280 miles
