[EXP] 1: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]: 16 eggs are laid per day by Janet's ducks. 3 are eaten by her for breakfast, and 4 are baked for her friends, so 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs remain. 9 eggs are sold at the farmers' market, and each egg is sold for $2. 9 x 2 = 18.  Janet makes $18 per day at the farmers' market.  The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 2: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 160, [output]: 200 GB is the size of the file Carla wants to download.  First, we need to calculate how many minutes it will take to download without interruptions.  200 GB / 2 GB per minute = 100 minutes.  40% of the way through the download means that Carla has downloaded 40% * 200 GB = 80 GB.  At 2GB/minute, it takes 80 GB / 2 GB per minute = 40 minutes to download 80 GB.  So it will take 40 minutes to download 80 GB and then 100 - 40 = 60 minutes to download the remaining 120 GB.  So the total time to download without interruptions is 40 + 60 = 100 minutes. 

Now, 20 minutes is added because Windows forces a restart to install updates.   So the total time to download without interruptions plus the update time is 100 + 20 = 120 minutes. 

Now, we need to add another 100 minutes because Carla has to restart the download from the beginning after the update.  120 + 100 = 220 minutes.  The answer is 220 minutes. 
[EXP] 3: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]: 20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, which means 0. 2 x 20 = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  After that, there are 20 - 4 = 16 students left.  25% of 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, which means 0. 25 x 16 = 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.  After that, there are 16 - 4 = 12 students left.   All these 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.  To find the percentage, we divide by the total students and multiply by 100:

(12/20) x 100 = 60

So 60% of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 4: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Samantha is now 31, and she is 6 years younger than Raymond, so Raymond must be 37.  At 23, Raymond had a son, so 37 - 23 = 14 years ago.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 5: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Let's break this problem into steps. 

Henry stopped after 20 miles for his first stop. 15 miles before the end of the trip, he made his second stop.  The trip was 60 miles in total, so 60 - 15 = 45 miles after his first stop.  So, he traveled from 20 miles to 45 miles during his trip between the two stops.  To find the difference between these two points, we subtract 20 from 45. 45 - 20 = 25.   The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 6: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Mike started with 0 points.  In the first 20 minutes, he scored 4 points.  So after 20 minutes, he had 4 points.  In the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more than in the first 20 minutes.  4 * 1. 25 = 5 more points.  So in the last 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 5 = 9 points.  Now, in total, he has 4 + 9 = 13 points.  The answer is 13. 
[EXP] 7: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]:  Grandma Jones had 5 pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces.  In total, she had 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of pie.  After the guests ate some, 14 pieces were left over.  So the guests must have eaten 40 - 14 = 26 pieces of pie.  The answer is 26. 
[EXP] 8: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]: 15 floors in the building, 8 units each floor, so there are 15 x 8 = 120 units in total. 3/4 of the building is occupied, so 120 * 3/4 = 90 units are occupied. 120 - 90 = 30 units are unoccupied.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 9: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Peter plans to get a ticket for 7 dollars and popcorn for 7 dollars, so for each trip it will cost him 7 + 7 = 14 dollars.  He has 42 dollars for the week.  So we must find out how many times 14 goes into 42.  To do this, we divide 42 by 14.   42 / 14 = 3, with no remainder.  Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 10: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1596, [output]:  Since the year is divided into two halves, the first half is 6 months.  So Aleena had to pay 6 x 140 = 840 dollars for the first half.  For the second half, she had to pay 10% less than 140 dollars per month.  10% of 140 is 14.  140 - 14 = 126 dollars per month.  For the second half, she had to pay for 6 months, so 6 x 126 = 756 dollars.  To find the total amount Aleena paid by the end of the year, we add the amount she paid for the first half and the second half, which is 840 + 756 = 1596.  The answer is 1596. 
[EXP] 11: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7425, [output]: 1 week has 7 days, including Saturday. 5 dance classes per day from Monday to Friday means a total of 5 x 5 = 25 classes. 8 classes on Saturday, making a total of 25 + 8 = 33 classes in a week. 15 students in each class, so the total number of students is 33 x 15 = 495 students. 495 students at 15 dollars each is 495 x 15 = 7425 dollars.  The answer is 7425 dollars. 
[EXP] 12: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, then David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.  Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.  To find the difference between the laundry done by Raymond and David, subtract the amount done by David from the amount done by Raymond. 200 - 100 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 13: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 15, [output]: 22 games were played in total. 8 more were won than lost. 22 divided evenly, we would expect 11-11 to be the split between wins and losses.  However, they won 8 more games than lost.  So, if we start with the 11 and add 8, they won 19 games.  The answer is 19. 
[EXP] 14: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 28, [output]:  Since Cindy has 4 pets, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.  Jan has 3 times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 x 6 = 18 pets.  The total is 18 + 6 + 4 = 28 pets.  The answer is 28. 
[EXP] 15: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 30 cars were originally in the traffic jam. 5 cars took an exit.  Then 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.  30 - 5 = 25 cars are left in the traffic jam.  So 25 - 20 = 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 16: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Amir eats 5 cookies.  Cody eats 3 times as many as Amir, so Cody eats 5 x 3 = 15 cookies.  In total, they eat 5 + 15 = 20 cookies.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 17: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]: 4 teachers x 2 lessons per teacher per day = 8 lessons per day. 8 lessons per day x 3 cleanings per lesson = 24 cleanings per day.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 18: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 95200, [output]: 4 years ago, Adrien's salary was $40000. 30% of $40000 is $12000, so Lylah's salary 4 years ago was $40000 - $12000 = $28000.  Four years later, Adrien's salary was 40% higher than before, so his new salary was 40% * $40000 = $16000 more than before.  $40000 + $16000 = $56000.  So Lylah's salary four years later was 40% * $28000 = $11200 more than before.  $28000 + $11200 = $39200.   Adrien and Lylah's salaries four years later were $56000 and $39200.   In total, the answer is $56000 + $39200 = $95200. 
[EXP] 19: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 82, [output]:  Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages means he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.  38 chicken sausages plus 44 fish sausages is 38 + 44 = 82.  The answer is 82. 
[EXP] 20: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. 6 times as many miles on Tuesday means he walked 4 * 6 = 24 miles on Tuesday.  So from Monday to Tuesday, he walked 4 + 24 = 28 miles. 41 miles is his total mileage from Monday to Wednesday, so 41 - 28 miles must have been walked on Wednesday. 41 - 28 is 13.  The answer is 13. 
[EXP] 21: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 20 cars are available for rent. 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. 12 + 4 = 16, so the rest of the cars are semi-automatic. 20 - 16 = 4.  This means that 4 out of 20 cars are semi-automatic. 4/20 = 0. 20, so the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is 20%.  The answer is 20%. 
[EXP] 22: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 75, [output]: 30 bees left the hive initially.  Then, 1/2 of that number returned. 1/2 of 30 is 15.  So 15 bees return in the next 6 hours.  
Then, Debra sees two times as many bees leave the hive as initially left.  2 x 30 = 60.  60 bees leave the hive.   But remember, every bee that left before didn't already return.   So Debra has to subtract the 15 that returned from the 60 that left.   60 - 15 = 45.  So 45 bees are left that didn't return.    Then, they return.   So Debra sees 45 bees return in the last 6 hours.  The answer is 45. 
[EXP] 23: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 272, [output]:  On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each 1 hour long.  That is 3 x 1 = 3 hours per day.   He does that 3 times a week.  So 3 x 3 = 9 hours per week on those days.  On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes, each 2 hours long.   That is 2 x 2 = 4 hours per day.   He does that 2 times a week.   So 4 x 2 = 8 hours per week on those days.  In each week, Kimo is in class for 9 + 8 = 17 hours.  In 16 weeks, he is in class 17 x 16 = 272 hours.  The answer is 272. 
[EXP] 24: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]:  Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.  So he caught a total of 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.  Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.  He caught 3 fewer sea horses, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.  He caught 2 more clownfish, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.   In total, Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.  Together, they caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 25: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Ethel has 8 dollars.  Jimmy has 2 more than twice the money Ethel has, so let's calculate twice the money Ethel has: 2 x 8 = 16.  Since Jimmy has 2 more, he has 16 + 2 = 18.  The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 26: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Juan and his brother sell lemonade.  For each gallon, they spend 3 dollars on lemons, 2 dollars on sugar.  So each gallon costs 3 + 2 = 5 dollars.  If they sell each glass for 0. 50, then with 20 glasses they make a total of 20 * 0. 50 = 10 dollars per gallon.   So after subtracting the cost, they make 10 - 5 = 5 dollars profit per gallon.  If they made 25 dollars in total profit, and this is from 5 dollars per gallon, then they must have made 25/5 = 5 gallons.   Each gallon takes 3 dollars worth of lemons, so they spent 5 * 3 dollars on lemons.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 27: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 23, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step!

First, we know that Jan is 30 years old. 

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.  Since two years ago, Jan's age was 30 - 2 = 28.  Half of 28 is 14, so Mark's age two years ago was 14 + 5 = 19.  To find Mark's current age, we add 2 years: 19 + 2 = 21.  Mark is 21 years old.  Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23.   The answer is 23. 
[EXP] 28: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]: 3 friends spent $20. 25 on tickets.  If they paid 4. 50 less on food, they must have spent 20. 25 - 4. 50 = 15. 75 on food.  So the total amount they spent is 20.  25 + 15.  75 = 36.   Then, they also spent 2 * 33 = 66 on the 2 rides.  So the total amount they spent is 36 + 66 = 102.   Since they split it evenly, they each paid 102 / 3 = 34.  The answer is 34. 
[EXP] 29: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]: 200 pounds of carrots are initially available. 40 restaurants each receive 2 pounds of carrots, so the total amount of carrots given out is 40 x 2 = 80 pounds. 200 - 80 = 120 pounds. 120 pounds will not be used.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 30: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 31, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step!

For the sandwiches: Carl used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, and he ate a sandwich every day this week, so that's 7 sandwiches. 2 slices per sandwich * 7 sandwiches = 14 slices. 

For the omelets: Carl used 3 omelets, and one more slice per omelet than for the sandwiches, which means he used 3 slices per omelet. 3 omelets * 3 slices per omelet = 9 slices. 

For the macaroni and cheese: Carl used 8 slices for that. 󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿

Now, we add it all up! 14 slices (from sandwiches) + 9 slices (from omelets) + 8 slices (from macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese Carl used. 󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿. 󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿. 󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿. 󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿.  󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿. 󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿. 󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿. 

The answer is 31. 
[EXP] 31: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 1.  The jacket is 30 dollars and each pair of shoes is 20 dollars. 2 pairs of shoes will be 2 x 20 = 40 dollars.  So Sara needs 30 + 40 = 70 dollars for the jacket and shoes.  Sara already had 10 dollars saved, so she needs 70 - 10 = 60 dollars to buy the jacket and shoes.  She earned 5 dollars each time she babysits and 4 dollars each time she mows the lawn.   From babysitting 4 times she earns 5 * 4 = 20 dollars.  The problem asks how many times must she mow the lawn, so let's assume she hasn't mowed the lawn yet and needs 60 - 20 = 40 more dollars.  Each time she mows the lawn, she earns 4 dollars, so she will need to mow the lawn 40 / 4 = 10 times.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 32: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 4 roses are in the vase. 7 more dahlias than roses means that there are 7 + 4 = 11 dahlias.  So in total there are 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers in the vase.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 33: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 180, [output]:  Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour. 3 hours will be 30 x 3 = 90 dollars.  Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.  5 hours will be 18 x 5 = 90 dollars.  90 + 90 is 180.  The answer is 180. 
[EXP] 34: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells, and Kylie collects 5 more shells, which is 20 + 5 = 25.  On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday.  So she collects 2 x 25 = 50 shells on Tuesday.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 35: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 68, [output]:  First, we know Jessa is 20 years old.  Since Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.  Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, which means Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.   Adding the ages of the 3 girls, we get 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.  The answer is 68. 
[EXP] 36: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another. 32 - 4 = 28, which is the difference.  The problem states that this difference is "twice the amount of fish in both aquariums".  This means that the capacity of fish in both aquariums combined is 28/2 = 14.  Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, this means that there are 14/2 = 7 fish in each aquarium.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 37: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 73, [output]:  Last night Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 10 + 15 = 25 animals.  Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars.  So if c is the number of cougars, the number of wolves is 3c.  He killed 3 fewer cougars than the night before, so the number of cougars now is 15 - 3 = 12.  So, the number of wolves is 3 times the number of cougars, which is 3 * 12 = 36.  The total number of animals killed today is the number of wolves plus the number of cougars: 36 + 12 = 48.  The total number of animals killed is 25 (last night) + 48 (today) = 73.  The answer is 73. 
[EXP] 38: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 168, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Andrea has 52 apples.  Since she has 8 more apples than Jamal, we know that Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.  We are also told that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas. 

We know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. 

In total, Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so there are 52 + 24 = 76 fruits.  The answer is 76. 
[EXP] 39: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 118000, [output]:  Mr.  Tan sold his house for $400,000.  He  paid  transfer  fees  that  amount  to  3%  of  the  selling  price.  3% of 400,000 is $\frac{3}{100}$ x 400,000 = 12,000.  So the transfer fees are 12,000.  

The brokerage fee  is 5% of the selling price.  5% of 400,000 is $\frac{5}{100}$ x 400,000 = 20,000.  So the brokerage fee is 20,000.  In  total,  Mr.  Tan  paid 12,000  +  20,000  =  32,000  dollars  in  fees.   

The remaining loan amount is  $250,000.   So  Mr.   Tan's  net  proceeds  from  selling  the  house  are  400,000  -  (32,000  +  250,000) =  400,000  -  282,000  =  118,000.  The answer is  118,000. 
[EXP] 40: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 315, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step.  We know the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, and the collar is one-tenth of that:

900 (body) + collar = 1800

So, the collar takes 900 ÷ 10 = 90 stitches. 

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar:

rosette = 2 x 90 = 180 stitches

Now, add the body, collar, and rosette to get the total number of stitches:

900 (body) + 90 (collar) + 180 (rosette) = 1170

We are given that the total number of stitches is 1800, so we need to find the number of stitches leftover from the 1170:

1800 (total) - 1170 (body + collar + rosette) = 630

The leftover stitches must be for the two sleeves, since they are the only remaining parts of the sweater.  Therefore, divide the leftover by 2 to find the number of stitches per sleeve:

630 ÷ 2 = 315

So each sleeve takes 315 stitches.  The answer is 315. 
[EXP] 41: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0. 25 each.  The total cost of the popsicles is 20 x $0. 25 = $5.   He bought 4 ice cream bars at $0. 50 each, so the total cost of the ice cream bars is 4 x $0. 50 = $2.  The total cost of everything is the cost of the popsicles plus the cost of the ice cream bars, so it is $5 + $2 = $7.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 42: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 76 stars are in the flag, consisting of three rows of 8 stars, two rows of 6 stars, and the rest are 5-star rows.  Three rows of 8 stars = 3 * 8 = 24 stars.  Two rows of 6 stars = 2 * 6 = 12 stars.   In total, 24 + 12 = 36 stars.  The remaining stars are 76 - 36 = 40 stars. 40 stars are then split into rows of 5 stars. 40/5 = 8.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 43: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Will starts with 15 oranges.  

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he will wash 8 oranges.  The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 4 years old (8 / 2 = 4).  The youngest son will wash 4 oranges.  Altogether, the sons will wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.  So Will has 15 - 12 = 3 oranges left unwashed.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 44: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 8, [output]: 16. 32 pages require 16 pieces of paper.  Each piece of paper creates 2 sides, front and back. 32 / 2 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 45: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Let's start by finding the savings when buying a tub of ice cream.  The original price was $13, and the new price is $11.  The difference is $13 - $11 = $2.   So you will save $2 per tub of ice cream.  Since you are buying 2 tubs, you will save 2 * $2 = $4.  Now let's calculate the savings for the packets of milk.   The discount is $0. 5 per packet.  Since you are buying 4 packets, you will save 4 * $0. 5 = $2.  To find the total savings, add the savings for the tubs of ice cream and packets of milk:  $4 (savings on tubs) + $2 (savings on milk packets) = $6.  The answer is $6. 
[EXP] 46: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each.  That is 2 x 6 = 12 people.  Then she also invited 3 families with 4 people each.  That is 3 x 4 = 12 people.   So in total, she invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.  There were 8 people who couldn't come due to illness, so we subtract 8 from the total: 24 - 8 = 16.  Then, 1/4 of that number, or 2, had previous commitments.  We subtract 2 from 16, so 16 - 2 = 14.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 47: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Jam has 3 boxes of pencils. 2 loose pencils.  So that is a total of 3 * some unknown number + 2 = 26.  Let's solve for the unknown number of pencils per box.  3 * unknown + 2 = 26.   Subtract 2 from both sides.  3 * unknown = 24.   Divide both sides by 3.  unknown = 8  So there are 8 pencils per box.   Each box has 8 pencils. 3 boxes have 3 * 8 = 24 pencils.   And there are 2 loose pencils.   24 + 2 = 26.   Jam has a total of 26 pencils.   Meg has 46 pencils.   Together they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.  We found that each box has 8 pencils.    To store all 72 pencils, they need to have 72 / 8 = 9 boxes.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 48: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Erin had 7 lollipops. 10 more were given to her, making it 7 + 10 = 17.  Then, 3 lollipops were given to Ella. 17 - 3 = 14.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 49: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 72, [output]:  Maria started with 8 shares of a stock for $8 each.  So she had 8 x 8 = $64 in total.  The price increased by 50%.  So she now has 8 x (1 + 0. 5) = 12 dollars for each share.  She has 12 dollars for 8 shares, so she has 12 * 8 = $96.  The price then decreases 25%.  So she now has 12 * (1 - 0. 25) = 9 dollars for each share.   So the total value of her shares is 9 * 8 = $72.  The answer is 72. 
[EXP] 50: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 180000, [output]:  Tyson runs 5000 meters every day.  1/5 more would be 1/5 x 5000 = 1000 more.  1000 + 5000 = 6000 meters per day.  6000 meters per day * 30 days = 180000 meters.  The answer is 180000. 
[EXP] 51: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 1.  On Monday, Peyton had a one hour yoga class.  2.  On Tuesday, the cooking class was three times as long.  So that is 1 * 3 = 3 hours.  3.   On Wednesday, Peyton had a half hour cheese tasting event.   4.   On Thursday, the museum tour took half as long as the cooking class.   The cooking class was 3 hours long.   Half of that is 3 / 2 = 1.  5.    On Friday, Peyton spent 2 hours on errands.    Now, let's add up all the hours: 1 for the yoga, 3 for the cooking class, 0. 5 for the cheese tasting, 1 for the museum tour, and 2 for the errands.    1 + 3 + 0. 5 + 1 + 2 = 7.  The answer is 7 hours. 
[EXP] 52: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Morgan's dad has $90 for her birthday party.  She wants to spend some of that on mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts.  A round of mini-golf costs $5.  She wants to play one round.  So she will spend  $5 for that.  She wants $5 in arcade tokens, so she will spend another $5.   And she wants to ride the go-karts twice.   Since it costs $10 per ride, she will spend $20 for that.   So, in total she will spend $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.   To find out how many friends she can invite, we need to find out how much money she will have left. 

She had $90 and spent $30.  $90 - $30 is $60.    Since she spends $5 per friend for everything, we need to divide $60 by $5.  $60 divided by $5 is 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 53: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 49, [output]: 96 fourth-graders initially.  43 of them are girls.  So, the number of boys is 96 - 43 = 53. 5 fourth-grade girls and 4 fourth-grade boys were absent.  So, the number of fourth-grade boys who were present is 53 - 4 = 49.  The answer is 49. 
[EXP] 54: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.  The next day, they sold double that number, which is 14 x 2 = 28.  On the last day, they sold one-half the number sold the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14.  But 6 people returned their shoes, so we subtract 6 from the 14 sold on the last day. 14 - 6 = 8.  So the total number of shoes sold in the sale is 14 + 28 + 8 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 55: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 50 socks need washing.  If Lindsay washed 10 pairs of socks, that's 10 x 2 = 20 socks.  And she also washed 15 loose socks.  20 + 15 = 35 socks washed so far.  If the problem wants to know how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to subtract the socks washed from the total.  50 - 35 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 56: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]: 50% of the choir is made up of boys, and 50% is made up of girls. 50% of 52 is 26 (half of 52 is 26). 26 are boys, so the remaining 52 - 26 = 26 are girls. 52 - 26 = 26.  The choir decided to perform with just the girls. 50% of the girls however couldn't make it because of a bus breakdown. 50% of 26 is 13.  Therefore 13 girls couldn't make it.  So the number of girls performing was 26 - 13 = 13.  The 3 teachers also decided to sing. 13 + 3 is 16.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 57: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]: 60 dollars were saved when Tim cancelled his cable subscription.  Now, Tim pays:

* Netflix: $10
* Hulu: Since Tim gets a 20% discount when bundling, Hulu's price is: $10 - (20% of $10) = $10 - $2 = $8
* Disney Plus: Since Tim gets a 20% discount when bundling, Disney Plus's price is: $10 - (20% of $10) = $10 - $2 = $8
Total monthly cost of streaming services: $10 + $8 + $8 = $26

So, Tim saves: $60 - $26 = $34.  The answer is $34. 
[EXP] 58: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  We can start by finding the age of Beth.  Since Erica is 30 and Beth is 5 years older, Beth is 30 + 5 = 35.  Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old.  So the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 59: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 200, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  There are 40 cannolis originally.  Then Allan bought 60 more cannolis.  So now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis. 

At Allan's house, there is twice as much corn as cannolis.  So, there are 2 times 40 = 80 corns initially.  Then we know he bought 40 fewer corns than the new number of cannolis.   The new number of cannolis is 100, so he bought 100 - 40 = 60 fewer corns.  

Now, we have the total corns as 80 - 60 = 20.  

There are 100 cannolis and 20 corns now in total.  So the combined total is 100 + 20 = 120.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 60: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]: 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of them WILL explode.  Since there are 50000 candles in total, the number of candles that will explode is 50000 * 1% = 500. 5% of the candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.  50000 * 5% = 2500 candles have this defect.  Since the problem asks how many candles both smell like wet dog and explode, we're looking for the intersection of these two groups.  This is just the product of the number of candles that explode and the number that smell like wet dog, but it's the same thing as the number of candles that explode times the percentage of those that also smell like wet dog.  The number of candles that explode is 500, so the number of candles that explode and smell like wet dog is 500 x 5% = 25.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 61: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17000, [output]:  Mr.  Josue started with 5000 dollars.  Then he got 4000 from the first bank.  The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so 2 x 4000 = 8000.  So the second bank gave him 8000 dollars.   After that, he had 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 dollars.  The answer is 17000. 
[EXP] 62: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 150, [output]:  Let's follow the steps:

1. 1/3 of the cards remain with Kenny after he sells the rest. 
2.  With $50 in spending cash, Kenny got the remaining money from the card sales. 
3.  The amusement park costs $100.  Kenny also has $50 in spending cash.  So, he has a total of $100 in his pocket.  The money from the card sales must be $100 - $50 = $50.  
4.   Kenny gets $1. 5 for each card he sells.   To find how many cards he sold, we can divide the money he got from selling cards ($50) by the price per card ($1. 5).  50 ÷ 1. 5 = 33. 33 (we round down because he couldn't sell a fraction of a card).  So, Kenny sold 33 cards.  Originally, he had 33 + 1/3 * 33 = 33 + 11 = 44 cards.   The answer is 44. 
[EXP] 63: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 5 dollars is 500 cents. 1% of 500 is 5 cents.  So George has 500 - 5 cents left.  500 - 5 = 495 cents. 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each will be 3 * 40 = 120 cents.  495 - 120 is 375 cents.  To find the number of candy bars George bought, we need to find how many 75 cents are in 375 cents. 375 / 75 is 5.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 64: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]: ubits solución:

Elizabeth tiene 1 pack of red beads (20 pieces) + 2 packs of clear beads (20 pieces x 2 = 40 pieces) = 60 pieces of beads.  Margareth tiene 3 packs of blue beads (20 pieces x 3 = 60 pieces) + 4 packs of red beads (20 pieces x 4 = 80 pieces) = 140 pieces of beads.  So Margareth has 140 - 60 = 80 pieces more beads than Elizabeth.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 65: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 539, [output]:  Let's start by calculating the total amount of money the salesman got for the sneakers. 17 sneakers at $20 each is 17 x 20 = 340.  The rest of the sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) were sold at $25 each, so that's 31 x 25 = 775.  The total amount of money the salesman got is 340 + 775 = 1115.  The salesman bought the sneakers for $576.  To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total amount he got: 1115 - 576 = 539.  The answer is 539. 
[EXP] 66: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1920, [output]:  Each bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall, so the volume of each bed is 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet. 10 such beds will require 10 * 32 = 320 cubic feet of potting soil.  One bag holds 2 cubic feet, so 320 / 2 = 160 bags are needed.  The cost of each bag is $12, so the total cost will be 160 * 12 = 1920.  The answer is 1920. 
[EXP] 67: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 71, [output]:  Ali started with 21 dollars.  Leila gave him half of her 100 dollars, which is 100/2 = 50 dollars.  So Ali now has 21 + 50 = 71 dollars.  The answer is 71.

[EXP] 70: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Let's start by finding out how many songs Luri has on his player.  Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, Luri has 20 * 3 = 60 songs.  Then we can find out how many songs they can add to their players.  Gabriel has 100 - 20 = 80 songs left.  Luri has 100 - 60 = 40 songs left.   The difference between 80 and 40 is 80 - 40 = 40.  So Luri can add 40 fewer songs than Gabriel can add.  The answer is 40.

Then she must have spent 7 - 3 = 4 dollars on strawberry gum. 4 dollars on 2 packs of gum means each pack of strawberry gum costs 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 74: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 110, [output]:  Gerald is paid 30 dollars per day.  He worked for 7 days, so he got 30 x 7 = 210 dollars.  After spending 100 dollars, he has 210 - 100 = 110 dollars left.  The answer is 110. 
[EXP] 75: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]: 4 $10 bills is 40 dollars. 6 $20 bills is 120 dollars.  So Ali has 40 + 120 = 160 dollars.  He gives his sister half of it, which is 160 / 2 = 80 dollars.  So he has 160 - 80 = 80 dollars left.   He uses 3/5 of the remaining money, which is 3/5 * 80 = 48 dollars.  So he has 80 - 48 dollars left.   The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 76: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  First, we need to find the number of cups of raisins that Heather can divide equally among the oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix.  The raisins were originally 27 cups.  Heather's goal is to divide the bag of raisins equally among these 3 purposes, so she has 27 / 3 = 9 cups for each purpose.  

Heather's oatmeal cookies need 3/4 cup of raisins per batch.  We need to find out how many batches she can make with 9 cups of raisins.  We can do this by dividing 9 cups by 3/4 cup, or multiplying 9 by 4/3. 9 * (4/3) = 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 77: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Jame will be 27 in 5 years.  So he is currently 27 - 5 = 22.  Since his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age 8 years ahead, his cousin will be 22 * 2 = 44 and 44 - 5 = 39 in 8 years.  Since Jame is currently 22, his cousin is currently 39 - 8 = 31.   To find out how many years separate their age, subtract Jame's age from his cousin's age. 31 - 22 = 9.  The answer is 9.

[EXP] 82: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  The tooth fairy gave Sharon $5. 00 for the first tooth.  Then, the tooth fairy gave her $1. 00 for each of the next three teeth.  So, the tooth fairy gave her 3 x 1. 00 = 3. 00 dollars more.  Then, for each of the last 2 teeth, the tooth fairy gave her half the amount of money as the previous three teeth.   So, she gave her $0.  50 for each of those 2 teeth.   $0. 50 * 2 = $1.  00.    So, she got 2.   00 dollars more.   Now we add up the total amount she got.   $5. 00 + $3.  00 + $1. 00 = $9.   00.  So, the tooth fairy left Sharon $9.  00 in total.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 83: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 37, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step.  The cost of bread is 3 dollars per loaf and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  So the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is 3 dollars.  They also spend 30 dollars on different cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches.   Total cost for 10 sandwiches is 3 + 30 = 33 dollars. 

Since they sell each sandwich for 7 dollars, revenue from 10 sandwiches is 7 * 10 = 70 dollars. 

Net profit is the revenue minus the cost.   Net profit is 70 - 33 dollars.  70 - 33 is 37 dollars.  The answer is 37 dollars. 
[EXP] 84: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 215, [output]: 1 hour and 30 minutes is the same as 1 * 60 + 30 = 90 minutes. 2 hours and 5 minutes is the same as 2 * 60 + 5 = 125 minutes. 125 + 90 = 215.  The answer is 215.

The answer is 52. 
[EXP] 86: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means that 5 years ago, Jerry's age was half of what it is now.  Let's say Jerry's age now is x.  5 years ago, his age was x - 5.   The problem states that x - 5 = x/2, which means that x = 10.  So Jerry's age now is 10.   In 3 years, his age will be 10 + 3 = 13.   The answer is 13. 
[EXP] 87: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the rate of the plane is 1200 / 3 = 400 miles per hour.  To travel an additional 2000 miles, it will take 2000 / 400 = 5 hours.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 88: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  There are many pieces to this problem, but we have to work step by step.  We start by finding how many croissants Juan will make.   4 dozen is 4 x 12 = 48 croissants.  He makes croissants for 7 days.   So total he makes 7 x 48 = 336 croissants. 

Next we want to know how much butter is needed for each croissant.  It takes 1/4 pound for 1 dozen, or 12 croissants, so for 1 croissant it is 1/4 / 12 = 1/48 pound.  For 336 croissants, he will need 336 x (1/48) = 7 pounds.  The answer is 7 pounds of butter.

[EXP] 90: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 12 years from now, Charmaine will be 16 years old. 4 years from now is the same as 12 years from now minus 8 years.  So Charmaine will be 16 - 8 = 8 years old 4 years from now.  But wait, she will be 8 years old 4 years from now! 13 years from now she will be 16 years old, so the answer is still 8 years. 
[EXP] 91: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 100 surfers ride the big wave, but only 25% can stay upright. 25% of 100 is 25. 25 surfers can stay upright.  Of these, 60% are women.  60% of 25 is 15.  So 15 women can stay upright.  To find the number of men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of surfers who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10

So 10 men can stay upright on the wave.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 92: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]:  Let's start by identifying what we know:

* Paisley ran 4 miles.  Reggie ran 5 times more than Paisley, so Reggie ran 5 x 4 = 20 miles.  Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Reggie's total distance was 20 miles, but Lynn's distance was 20 - 3 = 17 miles.  Reggie's total distance is 20 miles, Lynn's distance is 17 miles, and Paisley's distance is 4 miles.  That covers them all.  The correct answer is 17. 
[EXP] 93: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 29, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step!

1.  Steve's wife is 4 years older than him, so Steve's wife's age is 60 + 4 = 64.  Since their son is currently half as old as his mom, the son's age is 64 / 2 = 32.  Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so her age is 32 - 3 = 29.  The answer is 29. 
[EXP] 94: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2100, [output]:  Ariadne has a shop selling hats of two different colors, red and green. 

Let's break it down:

1.  In the first month, she sold red hats for 400 dollars.  This is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats.   If we call the total amount from green hats x, then 400 = x/2.  Multiplying both sides by 2, 800 = x.   So in the first month, she earned 800 dollars from green hats. 

2.  In the first month, she got 800 from green hats and 400 from red hats.   So the total she got in the first month is 800 + 400 = 1200. 

3.  In the second month, she got 3/4 of what she got in the first month.  She got 3/4 of 1200, which is 3/4 * 1200 = 900.   So she got 900 in the second month. 

4.  Total money earned in two months is the sum of the money earned in each month.   Money earned in the first month is 1200, and money earned in the second month is 900.  So in total, she earned 1200 + 900 = 2100.  The answer is 2100. 
[EXP] 95: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Let's break this problem into smaller parts.  If cooking rice took 30 minutes, then cooking pork took 20 more minutes.  So cooking pork took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.  Cooking beans took half the combined time of cooking pork and rice.  Combined time for cooking pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes.   Half of that is 40 minutes.  So cooking beans took 40 minutes. 

Now we have to add up the cooking times.  Cooking rice took 30 minutes, cooking pork took 50 minutes, and cooking beans took 40 minutes. 30 + 50 + 40 = 120.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 96: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 360, [output]: 150 teachers are on the court, and 60% are history teachers.  To find out how many are history teachers, we will calculate 60% of 150 teachers. 

60% of 150 is the same as (60/100) × 150.  Using a calculator, we get:

(60/100) × 150 = 90

So, 90 teachers are history teachers.  The rest are math teachers.  To find out how many math teachers there are, we subtract the number of history teachers from 150:

150 - 90 = 60

So, 60 teachers are math teachers.  These 60 math teachers sleep for 6 hours a day.  To find out how many hours the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the hours each teacher sleeps:

60 × 6 = 360

The math teachers collectively spend 360 hours sleeping in one day.  The answer is 360. 
[EXP] 97: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 30 days in the past. 12 were good, 8 were bad, and the rest were neutral. 12 + 8 = 20.  So there were 10 neutral days.  The first 8 days were good.  The second 8 days were bad.  The third 8 days were neutral.  The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. 12 good days were accounted for by the first 8 and the last 3, so there were 12 - 8 = 4 good days left.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 98: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 576, [output]: 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. 96 potatoes is 96/6 = 16 times more potatoes. 36 times 16 = 576. 576 hash browns can be made.  The answer is 576. 
[EXP] 99: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Greta baked 30 cookies.  Since Celinda baked twice as many, that means Celinda baked 2 x 30 = 60 cookies.  In total, they baked 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.   After eating 10 cookies, they were left with 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 100: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 68, [output]:  Brittany's comforter has 14 red squares. 4 more blue squares than red squares means she has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.  6 more green squares than blue squares means she has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.  12 fewer white squares than green squares means she has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares. 

Total number of squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares

Area of each square = 1 foot by 1 foot = 1 square feet
Total area of comforter = 68 squares * 1 square feet/square = 68 square feet

The answer is 68 square feet. 
[EXP] 101: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 135, [output]: 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each means there are 15 x 20 = 300 fireworks to be set off.  Hannah will see 40% of them, which is 40/100 * 300 = 120 fireworks.  Hannah also sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each. 3 x 5 = 15 firework.  120 + 15 = 135.  The answer is 135. 
[EXP] 102: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 40% of the water is used by the city.  Then, 80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes.  80% of 40% is 80% * 40% = 32%.  So, 40% - 32% = 8% is used for non-industrial purposes.  The answer is 8%. 
[EXP] 103: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  We need to calculate the total cost of James picking the blueberries.  First, it costs $20 to go picking.  Then it costs $1. 50 per pound, so for 30 pounds, the cost is 30 x $1. 50 = $45.   The total cost is $20 + $45 = $65.  If James had bought 30 pounds at the store, it would have cost 30 x $2. 50 = $75.   So James saved $75 - $65 = $10.   The answer is $10. 
[EXP] 104: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2450, [output]:  Helga's initial rate of tapping is 300 taps per minute for the right foot and 250 taps per minute for the left foot.  This means that in 1 minute, she taps a total of 300 + 250 = 550 times. 

If she raises her arms, the rate slows down to 200 taps per minute per foot.  Therefore, she taps a total of 200 + 200 = 400 times per minute with her arms raised. 

Since she dances for 5 minutes and raises her arms for only 2 minutes, the total number of times she taps her feet will be the sum of the taps when her arms are down and when they are up.  She spends 5 - 2 = 3 minutes with her arms down and 2 minutes with her arms up.  Therefore, the total number of taps would be (3 x 550) + (2 x 400).  This equals 1650 + 800.  The answer is 2450. 
[EXP] 105: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]: 15 + 45 = 60, which are the blue spools.  There are also other green spools.  40 + 50 = 90, which are the green spools.  In total, 60 + 90 = 150 spools.  The number of blue spools is (60/150)*100 = 40%.  The percent of her spools that are blue is 40.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 106: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 20% of 100 is 20. 50% more than 20 is 20 + 20 * 50 / 100 = 20 + 10 = 30.  Candidate B got 30 votes. 100 - 20 - 30 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 107: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]:  Let's say the number of students in each class is x.  Since in total there are 80 students and each class has the same number of students, we can set up the equation 2x = 80, which means x = 40.  Since each class has 40 students, the number of girls in each class is 40% of 40, or 16.  The number of boys in each class will be the remaining students, which is 40 - 16 = 24.   The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 108: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 3, [output]: 54 students are separated into 6 groups.  That means there are 54/6 = 9 students in each group.  Since the activity requires 12 groups, we have to add 12 - 6 = 6 groups.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 109: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]: 33 people total voted.  For the regulation, twice as many voted in favor as against.  So suppose x is the number of people who voted against, then 2x voted for.  So we can write the equation x + 2x = 33.  Simplify the equation: 3x = 33.  Divide both sides by 3: x = 11.  So there were 11 people against the regulation. 2x is the number of people for, which is 2 * 11 = 22.  The answer is 22. 
[EXP] 110: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

If the three houses need a total of 250 cases of shingles, that's the total. 

The first house needs 1/2 of the shingles that the second house needs.  Let's call the number of cases the second house needs "x".  Then, the first house needs x / 2. 

The third house needs double the shingles that the first house needs.  So the third house needs 2 * (x / 2) = x.  This is because the second house is x, and the third house is double the first house.  

Now we have three equations and three unknowns.   We know: 

- The first house needs x / 2, 
- The second house needs x, 
- The third house needs x, 
- The total is 250.  

We can write an equation for the total:   
x / 2 + x + x = 250 

We can simplify this by combining like terms:   
(3 / 2) x + x = 250 

Combine the terms:   
(5 / 2) x = 250 

Multiply by 2 to get rid of the fraction:   
5x = 500 

Divide by 5 to solve for x:   
x = 100 

The third house needs x, which is 100 cases of shingles.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 111: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 4 vanilla scents are available to start with.  So they sell 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents. 5 * 4 = 20 vanilla scents sold. 8 fruity scents are available. 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents are sold.  2 * 8 = 16 fruity scents sold. 20 vanilla scents - 16 fruity scents = 4 more vanilla scents sold.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 112: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4400, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  Mike has 600 movies.   A third of the movies are in various series.   To find how many movies are in series, you can multiply the total number of movies by 1/3.  600 x 1/3 is 200. 

These 200 movies will be replaced as a bundle at a discounted price.   The remaining movies are not part of a bundle, so they will be replaced individualy.  To find how many movies are not in series, we can subtract the number of movies in series from the total number of movies.   600 - 200 = 400. 

Using 40% for the older movies, we can find how many movies are older movies.   First, convert the decimal to a fraction, so 40% becomes 40/100.   Then multiply that fraction by the total number of movies that are not part of a series.   (40/100) * 400 = 160.  Mike has 160 older movies.  The remaining movies are normal movies.    So, the number of normal movies is 400 - 160 = 240.  For these movies, the cost is $10 each.  The total cost will be 10 * 240 = 2400.  For the movies in series, it is a bundle, so the price for a series is $6.   The number of movie series is 200.    The cost is 6 * 200 = 1200.  For the older movies, each costs $5.   So the total cost for older movies is 5 * 160 = 800.  To find the total cost of replacing the entire movie collection, add the costs for each type of movie.  2400 + 1200 + 800 = 4400. 
[EXP] 113: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step!

1.  Andy's car travels 5 miles one way, so the total distance he travels to work and back each day is 5 x 2 = 10 miles.  Since he does this from Monday to Friday, the total distance he travels in a week is 10 x 5 = 50 miles.  Since his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, we can calculate how many gallons of gas he uses in a week.  We divide the distance traveled by the fuel efficiency: 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons.  This means Andy uses 5 gallons of gas per week. 

2.  The current price of regular gas is $3 per gallon.  We can multiply the number of gallons Andy uses in a week by the gas price to find out how much he pays in a week: 5 gallons x $3 per gallon = $15.  The answer is $15. 
[EXP] 114: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]: 172 people started on the train. 47 people get off at the first stop. 172 - 47 = 125 people. 13 people get on at the first stop, so 125 + 13 = 138 people. 38 people get off at the next stop, so 138 - 38 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 115: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step.  Billy was first paid $10 per hour.  After 2 months, he got a 50 cent raise.  So his new rate is $10 + $0. 50 = $10. 50 per hour.  Then on his first anniversary, he got a $1. 00 raise to $11. 50 per hour. 

Sally started working at a different business and her starting salary was $0.  50 more than Billy's starting salary.   Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour, so Sally's is $10 + $0.  50 = $10.  50 per hour.   After two raises, Billy's rate is $11. 50 per hour and Sally's rate is $10. 50 per hour. 

If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours each, then their salaries are:
Billy: 20 x $11. 50 = $230. 00
Sally: 20 x $10.  50 = $210.  00

Billy will earn $230.  00 - $210.  00 = $20.  00 more than Sally. 
[EXP] 116: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1170, [output]: 600 + 300 = 900. 30% of 900 is (30/100) * 900 = 270. 900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
[EXP] 117: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 79, [output]:  Rose started off by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each. 3 x 5 = 15.  Then she picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  4 x 6 = 24.   She then picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  5 x 4 = 20.   Lastly, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each.  6 x 7 = 42.  In total that is 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101.  But she dropped one of each type of flower.  So she lost 1 x 5 = 5 + 1 x 6 = 6 + 1 x 4 = 4 + 1 x 7 = 7 = 22.  So 101 - 22 = 79.  The answer is 79. 
[EXP] 118: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 6,250, [output]: 20 students are working together to raise money for a charity, and since each earns the same amount, the total amount raised by the students must be equal to the total amount raised minus $50,000 (since $50,000 came from organizations). 175000 - 50000 = 125000. 125000 is the amount raised by the students. 125000/20 = 6250.  Each student raised $6250.  The answer is 6250. 
[EXP] 119: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]:  Cindy has 5 green eggs.  She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so that means she has 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs.  She has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.   She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.   In total, Cindy has 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.  The answer is 27. 
[EXP] 120: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 1 * 12 = 12 inches.  Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 12 * 4 = 48 inches.   Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 48 * 10 = 480 inches.   To convert to feet, we can divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot.   480 / 12 = 40 feet.  The answer is 40 feet. 
[EXP] 121: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's calculate the length of the unused glue for each stick:

1. 1/6 left, so 1 - 1/6 = 5/6 used, which means 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm used and 12 - 10 = 2 mm left unused. 2 mm is the length of the unused glue in this stick.  2. 2/3 left, so 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 used, which means 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm used and 12 - 4 = 8 mm left unused.   8 mm is the length of the unused glue in this stick.  3. 1/2 left, so 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 used, which means 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm used and 12 - 6 = 6 mm left unused.    6 mm is the length of the unused glue in this stick.  To find the total unused length of glue, add the unused lengths: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 122: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 975, [output]: 300 was Brenda's original amount. 3/4 of 300 is 225.  So she earned 225 each year.  After the first year, Brenda had 300 + 225 = 525.  After the second year, she had 525 + 225 = 750.  After the third year, she had 750 + 225 = 975.  The answer is 975. 
[EXP] 123: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 144, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes. 

In the next year, they will build "three times this many homes", which means they will build 3 x 12 = 36 homes. 

In the third year, they will "count how many homes they have built and double the amount".  They will count the homes they built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48.  Then they will double this amount, which is 2 x 48 = 96.  

So in total, over the next three years, the town will build 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.  The answer is 144. 
[EXP] 124: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  Let's figure out how many badges everyone earns in a year.  Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year she earns 12 badges.  Amber takes twice as long as Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 a badge per month, or 6 badges per year.  Wendy earns 3 times as many badges as Claire, or 3 * 12 = 36 badges per year.  To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract how many Amber earns from how many Wendy earns.  36 (Wendy) - 6 (Amber) = 30.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 125: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 30 kids times 4 jello cups per kid is 30 x 4 = 120. 120 jello cups divided by 10 cups per box is 120 ÷ 10 = 12 boxes.  The total cost of 12 boxes of jello will be 12 x $1. 25 = $15.  The answer is $15. 
[EXP] 126: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  Paul started with 52 marbles.  He then received 28 more marbles, so he had 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.  Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles, which is 80/4 = 20 marbles.  So, he has 80 - 20 = 60 marbles left.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 127: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 5 packs of bacon for 10 dollars means each pack of bacon is 10 / 5 = 2 dollars.  Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so it is 2 * 2 = 4 dollars. 6 packets of chicken would be 4 * 6 = 24 dollars.   3 packs of strawberries at 4 dollars each is 3 * 4 = 12 dollars. 7 packs of apples at half the price of a pack of strawberries (2 dollars) is 7 * 2 = 14 dollars.  In total, Kelly spent 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 dollars.  She started with 65 dollars. 65 - 60 = 5.  Kelly has 5 dollars left in her budget.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 128: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Let's start by calculating the total number of petals on the orchids. 5 orchids each with 5 petals is 5 x 5 = 25 petals.  The African daisies have 4 daisies and each daisy has 10 petals, so the African daisies have 4 x 10 = 40 petals.  To find how many more petals the daisies have, subtract the number of petals on the orchids from the number of petals on the daisies: 40 - 25 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 129: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 250, [output]:  John rents out his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time.  That is 10 x 3 = 30 hours in total.  He gets paid $25 an hour. 30 x 25 is 750.  He has to pay $500 for the car, so his profit is 750 - 500 = 250.  The answer is 250. 
[EXP] 130: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]: 1. 4 small masks require 2 yards of material, so we must find the total yards needed for 20 small masks.  20 * (2 yards / 4 small masks) = 20 * (0. 5 yards) = 10 yards.  2.  3 large masks require 2. 25 yards of material, so we must find the total yards needed for 8 large masks.   8 * (2. 25 yards / 3 large masks) = 8 * (0.  8333333 yards) = 6.  6666667 yards.  In total, Jo needs 10 + 6.   6666667 yards = 16.   6666667 yards of material.  The answer is 16.

[EXP] 133: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Let's start by identifying how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.  Since the sloth takes 4 hours to make one trip, we can divide 8 hours by 4 to get the number of trips.  8 / 4 = 2. 

Since the sloth needs to collect a total of 24 berries, we can divide 24 by 2 to find out how many berries he needs to collect on each of his 2 trips.  24 / 2 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  

Paul is 10 years older than Jean.  Let's call Jean's age "x".   Then, Paul's age is x + 10.   

Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.   So, Peter's age is equal to (x + 10) + x.  Simplifying, Peter's age is 2x + 10.  The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100.  So, the sum of their ages is 100.  We can set up the equation:   (2x + 10) + (x + 10) + x = 100   Simplifying and rearranging, 4x + 20 = 100   Subtracting 20 from both sides,  4x = 80   Dividing both sides by 4,  x = 20   So, Jean's age is 20.  Then, Paul's age is 20 + 10 = 30, and Peter's age is 2 * 20 + 10 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 135: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  John earned 50 dollars per hour and worked 6 hours.  So he earned 50 x 6 = 300 dollars.  After spending 50 dollars on gas, he will have 300 - 50 = 250 dollars.  He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so after doing that he will have 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left.  The problem doesn't give us the exact number of 25-dollar pens we are solving for, it's a way to calculate how much he will have left over.  But it gives us the framework to solve the problem.  The problem tasks you to find out the "after he buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each.  So first we need to find out how much 5 pencils cost, which is 5 x 10 = 50 dollars.   Then we take 150 - 50 dollars off, which is 100.   100/25 = 4.  The answer is 4 pens. 
[EXP] 136: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step!.  James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0. 6 x 20 = 12 miles.  He swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, so he takes 12 / 2 = 6 hours to swim the first part.  After that, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.   The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.   He then swims this distance at half his original speed, so 1 mile per hour.  It will take him 8 hours for this last part.    So in total, it took James 6 hours for the first part + 3 hours resting + 8 hours for the last part.    The answer is 17 hours. 
[EXP] 137: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 360, [output]:  Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we need to first find out how many 15-minute intervals there are between 8:00 AM and 11:00 PM. 8:00 AM till 11:00 PM is 15 hours. 15 hours * 4 15-minute intervals per hour is 60.  So Vince stapled for 60 intervals. 60 intervals * 30 reports per interval is 1800 reports.  The answer is 1800. 
[EXP] 138: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Coach brought some balls to practice.  Let's say this number of balls is x.   Jordan carried 2 times as many balls as Jason.  Jordan carried 2 * Jason's balls.   And Jason carried 2 times as many balls as Jeffrey.   Jason carried 2 * Jeffrey's balls.    We know Jason packed 2 balls.   So Jason's balls = 2.   Since Jason carried 2 times as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey's balls = Jason's balls / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1.  Jordan carried 2 times as many balls as Jason, so Jordan's balls = 2 * Jason's balls = 2 * 2 = 4.  Initially, x balls were brought in total.   Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls = x.  4 + 2 + 1 = x.  7 = x.  So the coach brought 7 balls to practice initially.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 139: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]:  Let's start by converting the brownies to a standard unit. 1 dozen brownies is 12 brownies.  So:

* Greta got 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. 
* She got 1/2 a dozen brownies at her office, which is 6 brownies. 
* She got 4 dozen brownies at her surprise party, which is 48 brownies. 
* At the party, 1 1/2 dozens brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies. 

Adding up the total number of brownies Greta got, we get: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.  After eating 18 brownies, she had 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left.  The answer is 48. 
[EXP] 140: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 79, [output]:  The number of states in the USA is 50.  Half of 50 is 25. 4 more than 25 is 25 + 4 = 29.  Since India has 29 states, the total number of states in both countries is 50 + 29 = 79.  The answer is 79. 
[EXP] 141: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]:  Adrianne started with 20 metallic beads.  Her sister gave her 10 more than her mother, which is 10 more than 20, so 10 + 20 = 30.  Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, which is 2 * 20 = 40.  In total, she received 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.  The answer is 90. 
[EXP] 142: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 30 pounds of soil has already been used by the 10 carnations (10 x 1. 5 = 15 pounds) and the 4 sunflowers (4 x 3 = 12 pounds).  Together, that adds up to 15 + 12 = 27 pounds.  So, they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds of soil left.  Each rose needs 1 pound, so they can plant 3 roses.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 143: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Tobias howls for 20 seconds.  Chikote howls for twice as long, which is 20 * 2 = 40 seconds.  Igneous howls for the combined total of the other two, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  So, the combined length of the howls is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.  Convert 120 seconds to minutes by dividing by 60: 120 / 60 = 2.  The answer is 2 minutes. 
[EXP] 144: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  First, calculate the total time she will need to make the cake including preparing the batter, baking, cooling, and frosting.  

Preparing the batter takes 20 minutes.  Baking takes 30 minutes.   The total time so far is 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.   

Next, it takes 2 hours or 120 minutes to cool the cake.   120 minutes is added to the total, making the total 50 + 120 = 170 minutes.   

Finally, it takes 10 minutes to frost the cake, so the total time with this added is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes. 180 minutes is equal to 3 hours.  This means Jordan needs to start making the cake no later than 2:00 pm to finish it in time to serve it at 5:00 pm.  Therefore, the answer is 2:00 pm. 
[EXP] 145: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 230, [output]: 55 miles per hour for 4 hours is 55 * 4 = 220 miles. 45 miles per hour for 10 hours is 45 * 10 = 450 miles.  450 - 220 = 230.  The answer is 230. 
[EXP] 146: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 78, [output]: 15 packs originally contained 60 pieces each, so in total there were 15 * 60 = 900 pieces of sweets. 2 packs were kept, which would be 2 * 60 = 120 pieces. 900 - 120 = 780 pieces left. 780 pieces were given to 10 friends, so each friend received 780 / 10 = 78.  The answer is 78. 
[EXP] 147: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Let's start by finding the price of large stuffed animals.  Since they are three times the price of small stuffed animals, and each small stuffed animal costs 4 dollars, then each large stuffed animal costs 3 x 4 = 12 dollars.  Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, say she sold s small stuffed animals and l large ones.  This means that:
s = 2l
We are also given that the total money earned was 120 dollars.  So, we know that:
4s + 12l = 120
Substituting for s in terms of l, we get:
4(2l) + 12l = 120
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
8l + 12l = 120
20l = 120
l = 6
Now we can find s, the number of small stuffed animals:
s = 2l
s = 2(6)
s = 12
So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 148: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 34, [output]: 1st, calculate the number of burst red balloons.  40% of 25 is 10, so 10 red balloons burst.  Now, the number of remaining red balloons is 25 - 10 = 15.  Next, calculate the number of yellow balloons Sally released.  She had 12, but released half of them, so she released 6.  Now, she has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.  Sally caught 8 blue balloons, and added 75% of them to her clutch.   75% of 8 is 6, so she added 6 blue balloons.  Adding these to the remaining red and yellow balloons, she had 15 red, 6 yellow, and 6 blue balloons.  In total, she had 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 balloons.  The answer is 27. 
[EXP] 149: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 40 apples originally. 2 boxes. 40 x 2 = 80 apples.  If each pack has 8 apples, then 80 / 8 = 10 packs. 8 goes into 80 10 times.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 150: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 130000, [output]: 26 countries were in South America. 5 cities each with 1000 people, so in each country there are 5 x 1000 = 5000 people. 26 countries times 5000 people per country is 26 x 5000 = 130000. 130000 people.  The answer is 130000. 
[EXP] 151: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 655, [output]: 1955 kilometers is the total distance.  Bernice has driven 325 kilometers for 4 days. 325 * 4 = 1300 kilometers, so she has driven 1300 kilometers.  The distance she still needs to drive is 1955 - 1300 = 655.  The answer is 655. 
[EXP] 152: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]: 4 movies are watched every Saturday. 4 movies on Saturday and half as many on Sunday is 4 / 2 = 2 movies on Sunday.  So they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies on the weekend.  4 weeks means 4 weekends.  4 weekends * 6 movies per weekend is 4 * 6 = 24 movies.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 153: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 247, [output]: 32 classes visited on Monday. 2 times as many visited on Tuesday.  So 2 x 32 = 64 visited on Tuesday.  3 times as many visited on Wednesday.  So 3 x 32 = 96 visited on Wednesday.  On Thursday, 30 classes visited.  On Friday, 25 classes visited.  So the total number of classes is 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247.  The answer is 247. 
[EXP] 154: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 251, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  

First, let's find the number of people invited.  Kayla invited her 25 classmates, 7 girls in her dance class, and 13 family members, making a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45.  However, 4 people said they couldn't come, so we subtract 4 from this total.  45 - 4 = 41.  Since the movie theater is rented for a party of 20, plus an additional fee for each guest, we need to calculate the additional fee first.  We need to subtract 20 from the total number of guests to get the number of additional guests: 41 - 20 = 21.  The additional fee is $6 per guest, so the additional cost is $6 * 21 = $126.  Finally, we add the base fee of $125 and the additional fee to get the total cost: $125 + $126 = $251.  The answer is $251. 
[EXP] 155: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Melanie has saved 12 * 10 = 120 toothpicks. 200 - 120 = 80. 80 toothpicks left to go. 80/10 = 8. 8 more weeks until she reaches 200 toothpicks.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 156: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]: 8 inches in 4 years, so 8/4 = 2 inches per year. 2 inches per year for 13 years is 2 x 13 = 26 inches.  The answer is 26. 
[EXP] 157: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1080, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step:

1.  The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, which means it ate 1/2 of the whole amount.  Let's call the total amount x.   Then, the amount eaten by the T-Rex is 1/2x. 
2.   The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, which means they ate 1/2 of what was left after the T-Rex ate.   Since the T-Rex ate 1/2x, there is 1/2x left.   Half of 1/2x is 1/4x, so the velociraptors ate 1/4x.  This means 1/4x was left after the velociraptors ate. 
3.  The Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat, which is the remaining amount after the velociraptors ate.  So, 1/4x = 270.  To find x, we can multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction.   This gives us 4/4x = 4*270, which simplifies to x = 1080.  The total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.  The answer is 1080. 
[EXP] 158: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Let's first calculate how long it takes to slide down the biggest slide:

The distance is 300 feet and the speed is 60 feet per minute. 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes.  It will take 5 minutes to slide down the biggest slide.  Now let's calculate how long it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:

The distance is 240 feet and the speed is 80 feet per minute. 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.   It will take 3 minutes to slide down the second biggest slide.  Now we can calculate how much longer it takes to slide down the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide:

5 minutes (biggest slide) - 3 minutes (second biggest slide) = 2 minutes.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 159: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 100 centimeters must be cut into 4 equal parts. 100 divided by 4 is 25.  So each of the 4 initial cuts will be 25 centimeters.  Each of those pieces will then be cut into 5 equal parts. 25 divided by 5 is 5.  So each final cut will be 5 centimeters.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 160: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: -3, [output]:  Let's start by subtracting 8 degrees from the initial temperature: 2 - 8 = -6.  Then, let's add 3 degrees to the result: -6 + 3 = -3.  The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius.  The answer is -3. 
[EXP] 161: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 560, [output]:  John visits his parents twice a month, so that is 2 round trips.  Each round trip takes him 4 hours (2 hours each way).  He drives at 70 mph, so we need to calculate the distance for one trip:

Distance = Speed * Time = 70 * 2 = 140 miles

For 2 round trips, the distance is 2 times the distance for one trip:

Total distance = 2 * 140 = 280 miles

The answer is 280. 
[EXP] 162: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 750, [output]:  This problem is a bit more complex than the previous ones.  First, we have to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car.  The 2nd fastest car is 5 times the speed of the average car.  Since the average car goes 120 mph, the 2nd fastest car goes 5 x 120 = 600 mph.  The fastest car goes 1. 25 times the speed of the 2nd fastest car.  So the fastest car goes 1. 25 x 600 mph = 750 mph.  The answer is 750. 
[EXP] 163: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Jane has been saving 4 dollars a week for 8 weeks. 4 x 8 = 32.  Now she has 32 dollars. 60 - 32 = 28.  So she needs to save 28 more dollars.  Since she is saving 4 dollars a week, it will take her 28 / 4 = 7 more weeks.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 164: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 3 eggs per day for 30 days will be 3 * 30 = 90 eggs. 5 eggs per day for 30 days will be 5 * 30 = 150 eggs. 90 + 150 is 240.  To get dozens from total eggs, divide the total by 12. 240 / 12 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 165: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]: 1 dozen is 12 eggs. 3 dozen is 12 x 3 = 36 eggs. 36 eggs are given to 4 children. 36 / 4 = 9. 9 eggs will be given to each child.  The answer is 9.

[EXP] 167: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 1st I should find half of Haley's age. 26 / 2 = 13. 10 less than that is 13 - 10 = 3.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 168: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Ronnie was given $5.  Rissa was given thrice as much, so she was given 5 * 3 = 15 dollars.  After they each gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call that equal amount x.  So Ronny will have 5 - x and Rissa will have 15 - x. 

Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so 15 - x = (4/5) * 15. 15 - x = 12, which means x = 3.  So Ronny would have 5 - 3 = 2 dollars left.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 169: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 5 inches is the original piece of chalk.  20% of the chalk was used up on monday.  20% of 5 is 1.  5 - 1 = 4 inches.  Then 45% of the chalk was used on monday.  45% of 5 is 2.  5 - 2 = 3 inches.  2 inches is the size from which the teacher recycles the chalk.   He is left with 3 inches.  His daily use of 20% of the chalk means 1 inch per day.  3 inches ÷ 1 inch per day is 3 days.  Therefore the teacher will have 3 days left before the chalk is smaller than 2 inches, requiring recycling.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 170: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 11, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.  Newton picked them up and put one in his pocket, so he had 1 apple in his pocket and 1 apple left. 

He threw the remaining apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.  So now, he has the 1 apple in his pocket, and 5 + 1 = 6 apples that fell out of the tree. 

Newton put all but 1 of these 6 apples in his pocket, so he has 6 - 1 = 5 apples in his pocket now.  He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out.  

Now, he has 5 apples in his pocket, and 6 apples that just fell out of the tree, making a total of 5 + 6 = 11 apples.   He went home with these 11 apples, so the answer is 11. 
[EXP] 171: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 19, [output]:  The problem is: "A nurses' station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50.  On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages.  On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages.   On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack.   They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.   How many bandages did they start with on the first day?"

Let's break it down step by step:

* They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages on the first day, and used 38 bandages.  
So, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left. 
* On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 28 bandages (38 - 10).  After using 28 bandages, they had 12 - 28 = -16 bandages left.   This is impossible, since you can't have a negative number of bandages.   That means they must have received more bandages on the second day.   50 bandages would have been enough to account for the 28 used bandages.   So, they started the second day with 12 + 50 = 62 bandages. 
* On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each.  They used a half of one pack, so they used 25 more bandages.   After using the 25 bandages, they had 62 - 25 = 37 bandages left.  
* They ended the day with 78 bandages, so they must have received 78 - 37 = 41 bandages.  These must have been the 25 from the third day's half pack and 16 from the second day (62 - 46, the bandages they had after ordering the second batch). 
* So, from the beginning of the first day to the end of the third day, the total number of bandages they received was 50 + 50 + 41 = 141.  From the end of the first day to the end of the third day, they used 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 bandages.   That means they must have received 141 - 91 = 50 bandages on the first day. 


So they started with 50 bandages on the first day.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 172: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2400, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.  This means each bottle of scotch costs $60. 

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 10 x 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.  Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than the scotch, so each costs $60 + ($60 x 0. 5) = $90.  This means the total cost of the cognac is 20 x $90 = $1800.  The total cost of everything is then $600 + $1800 = $2400.  The answer is 2400. 
[EXP] 173: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 168, [output]: 700 is the original total. 40% of 700 is 40/100 * 700 = 280.  Team Alphas found 280 shells. 700 - 280 = 420.  This is the remaining amount of shells.  Team The finders found 420 * 60/100 = 252.  So 252 were found by The finders.  The total amount of shells by Alphas and The finders is 280 + 252 = 532.  The total amount of shells, 700, minus 532 gives 168.  The Gogetters must have found 168.  The answer is 168.

The answer is 225. 
[EXP] 176: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Let's start by using the given information that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.  If we represent the number of cupcakes as c, then the number of brownies is 3c - 2. 

Since each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 5 x 2 = 10.  Since we know that the total number of cupcakes and brownies together is 10, then we have the equation: 

c + (3c - 2) = 10

We can combine like terms: 

4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 

4c = 12

Divide by 4: 
c = 3.  So the number of cupcakes Carly made is 3.  The answer is 3.

[EXP] 185: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 34, [output]:  Charisma spends 15 minutes twice a day which is 30 minutes total.  5 days a week for 30 minutes a day is 30 * 5 = 150 minutes in a week.  Since there are 4 weeks, she spends in total 150 * 4 = 600 minutes in meditation.  Moreover, she practices 1 hour which is 60 minutes of yoga a day for 5 days a week.  So, she spends 5 * 60 = 300 minutes a week on yoga.  In 4 weeks, she spends 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes on yoga.   Then, in total, she spent 600 minutes on meditation and 1200 minutes on yoga, which is 1800 minutes. 1800 minutes can be converted into hours by dividing it by 60.  1800 / 60 = 30.  The answer is 30 hours.

[EXP] 188: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2280, [output]:  First, we find out how much Kim raised.  Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra.  So Kim raised 430 + 320 = 750.  

Next, we find out how much Maryam raised.   Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah.   Sarah raised 300 dollars.  So Maryam raised 300 + 400 = 700.   

Now we can find out how much money all the girls raised.   Alexandra raised 430, Kim raised 750, Sarah raised 300, and Maryam raised 700.   So in total, they raised 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 = 2280.  The answer is 2280. 
[EXP] 189: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 230, [output]: 80% off of $400 means the radiator costs 80% of 400, which is $320. 320 is the cost of the radiator.  Additionally, he pays for 3 hours of mechanic time at $50 an hour.  3 * 50 is 150, so that is the cost of the mechanic time.  The total cost is 320 + 150. 320 + 150 is 470.  The answer is 470.
