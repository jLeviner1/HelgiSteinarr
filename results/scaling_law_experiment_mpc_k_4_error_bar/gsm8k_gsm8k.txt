[EXP] 1: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.  Janet eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 to bake muffins.  So she has 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 duck eggs left.   She sells them for $2 each. 9 times $2 is 18.  The answer is $18. 
[EXP] 2: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 160, [output]: 200 GB is the total size of the file.  Carla can download 2 GB per minute.  After 40% of the file is downloaded, that is 200 * 0. 4 = 80 GB.  It takes her 80 / 2 = 40 minutes to do that.  Then to upgrade takes 20 minutes, and then she has to download the rest of the file (200 - 80 = 120 GB).  So the time to download the rest is 120 / 2 = 60 minutes.  The total time she takes to download the file is 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 3: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]: 20% of 20 students is 20*0. 2 = 4.  So 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  After 4 students opted for contemporary dance, 20 - 4 = 16 students are left.  25% of 16 students is 16*0. 25 = 4.  So 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.   After 4 students opted for jazz dance, 16 - 4 = 12 students are left.   So 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance. 

Since 12 students out of 20 in total enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to find what percentage 12 is out of 20:

(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

So 60% of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance.  The answer is 60%. 
[EXP] 4: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Samantha is now 31 years old.  Raymond is 6 years younger than Samantha, so he is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.  Raymond had a son at the age of 23, which means he had a son 25 - 23 = 2 years ago.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 5: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]: 60 miles are in total, and 20 miles were travelled before he stopped for the first time.  Then there remain 60 - 20 = 40 miles left.  He stopped again 15 miles before the end of the trip, which means that he travelled 40 - 15 miles between the two stops.  40 - 15 is 25.   The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 6: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes.  Then, he scored 25% more points in the second 20 minutes.  Since 25% = (25/100) = 1/4, he scored (1/4) x 20 = 5 more points in the second 20 minutes.  So he scored 4 + 5 = 9 points in the second 20 minutes.  In total, he scored 4 + 9 = 13 points.  The answer is 13. 
[EXP] 7: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]: 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces, is a total of 5 x 8 = 40 pieces.  After the guests had eaten, there were 14 pieces left.  So the guests took 40 - 14 = 26 pieces.  The answer is 26. 
[EXP] 8: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]: 





Let's find the total number of units first.  There are 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units, so the total number of units is 15 x 8 = 120 units. 

If 3/4 of the building is occupied, that means the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90 units.  The total number of unoccupied units is 120 - 90 = 30 units.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 9: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 42 dollars for the week, he wants to spend 7 dollars for a ticket and 7 dollars for popcorn. 7 + 7 = 14.  So he spends 14 dollars each time he goes to the movie. 42 divided by 14 is 3.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 10: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1596, [output]:  Aleena started by paying $140 per month. 6 months have passed, so she paid 6 * 140 = 840 dollars.  Now for the next 6 months, the streaming service charges 10% less, which is 10% of 140 = 14 dollars.  So than the streaming service charges 140 - 14 = 126 dollars per month.  For the next 6 months, Aleena paid 6 * 126 = 756 dollars.  The total amount she paid is 840 + 756 = 1596.  The answer is 1596 dollars. 
[EXP] 11: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7425, [output]:  Monday to Friday, Judy teaches 5 classes per day. 5 classes per day for 5 days is 5 x 5 = 25 classes.  On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.  In total, she teaches 25 + 8 = 33 classes.  Each class has 15 students.  So the total number of students she has is 33 x 15 = 495.  Each student pays 15 dollars.  So in total, Judy makes 495 x 15 = 7425 dollars.   The answer is 7425. 
[EXP] 12: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.  If David does 1/4 of this (since she does 4 times more), David does 400/4 = 100 pounds of laundry.  Raymond does half as much as Sarah, which is 400/2 = 200 pounds.  So to find the difference between Raymond's and David's laundry, do 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 13: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Let's say the team lost x games.  Since they won 8 more games than they lost, they must have won x + 8 games.  Since they played a total of 22 games, the number of games they won is x + 8 plus the number of games they lost (which is x).  The total number of games is equal to the number of games won plus the number of games lost, so we can write the equation (x + 8) + x = 22.  To solve for x, we can combine the x terms on the left side: 2x + 8 = 22.  To isolate x, we can subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 22 - 8 = 14.   Finally, we can divide both sides by 2 to find x = 7.   This means the team lost 7 games and won 7 + 8 = 15 games.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 14: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 28, [output]:  If Cindy has 4 pets, then Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.  Since  Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, Jan has 6 * 3 = 18 pets.  In total, they have 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets.  The answer is 28. 
[EXP] 15: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 30 cars originally were on the motorway. 5 cars took an exit, so that leaves 30 - 5 = 25 cars.  The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25. 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.  So the number that drove through in the first 15 minutes must be 25 - 20 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 16: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Amir eats 5 cookies. 3 times 5 is 15, so Cody eats 15 cookies. 5 + 15 = 20.  They eat 20 cookies together.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 17: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]: 4 teachers use the whiteboard.  Each teacher uses the whiteboard in 2 lessons per day.  So, the whiteboard is used 4 x 2 = 8 times per day.  If the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, then the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned is 8 * 3 = 24.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 18: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 95200, [output]: 30% of 40000 is 12000.  So 12000 more than Lylah's salary means her salary was 28000.  Four years later, Adrien's salary increased to 40000 * (1 + 40%) = 40000 * 1. 4 = 56000.  Since both salaries increased equally, Lylah's salary increased the same percent as Adrien's, which is 40%.  28000 * (1 + 0. 4) = 28000 * 1. 4 = 39200.   Therefore, Adrien's salary is 56000 and Lylah's is 39200.  Adrien's and Lylah's total salary is 56000 + 39200 = 95200.   The answer is 95200. 
[EXP] 19: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 82, [output]:  Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages means that he bought 38 + 6 fish sausages. 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages. 38 + 44 = 82 sausages.  The answer is 82. 
[EXP] 20: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 

Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday.  That means he walked 4 x 6 = 24 miles on Tuesday. 

The total mileage from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles.  We need to find how many miles he walked on Wednesday. 

So, Monday and Tuesday, he walked a total of 4 + 24 = 28 miles.  So, on Wednesday, he must have walked 41 - 28 = 13 miles.  The answer is 13. 
[EXP] 21: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 20 cars are available. 12 of them are automatic and 4 are manual, so we subtract 12 + 4 = 16 cars. 20 - 16 = 4 cars are semi-automatic.  To find the percentage, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100: 4/20 * 100 = 20%.  The answer is 20%. 
[EXP] 22: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 75, [output]: 30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours.  Then, 30 / 2 = 15 bees returned in the next 6 hours.  Then, twice the amount of bees that left the hive before returned in the next 6 hours.  2 * 30 = 60 bees.  So, in total, 15 + 60 = 75 bees returned to the hive in the first 18 hours of the day.  Then, 30 bees that left before returned to the hive in the next 6 hours.  So, in total, 75 + 30 = 105 bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 23: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 272, [output]:  Kimo attends classes on Mondays (3 hours), Wednesdays (3 hours), and Fridays (3 hours) for a total of 3 x 3 = 9 hours per week.  He also attends classes on Tuesdays (2 x 2 hours) and Thursdays (2 x 2 hours) for a total of 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 hours per week.  In one week, he attends classes for 9 + 8 = 17 hours.  In one semester (16 weeks), he attends classes for 17(hours/week) x 16(weeks) = 272 hours.  The answer is 272. 
[EXP] 24: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]:  Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.  That makes 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.   Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.  He caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.  And 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.  Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.  In total, Anakin and Locsin caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 25: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Ethel has 8 dollars. 2 times that is 8 x 2 = 16.  Jimmy has 2 more dollars than that.  16 + 2 is 18.  The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 26: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Let's figure out how much it costs for one gallon. 3 dollars for lemons and 2 dollars for sugar is 5 dollars total.  For 20 glasses, they sell 20 x $0. 50 = $10.  So, for one gallon, they make $10 and spend $5, for a profit of $5.  If they made $25 total profit, we need to find out how many gallons they made.   So, $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.   Now, for those 5 gallons, they spent 5 x 3 = 15 dollars on lemons.   The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 27: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 23, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Jean is two years older than Mark.  So Jean's current age is Mark's current age + 2. 

Next, the problem states that two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.   Jan is currently 30, so two years ago Jan was 28.  This means that two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half 28.  

Half of 28 is 14, and 5 years older than 14 is 19.   So Mark was 19 two years ago.  Since two years have passed since then, Mark's current age is 21.   (19 + 2 = 21)

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23.  The answer is 23. 
[EXP] 28: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 34, [output]: 3 friends spent 20. 25 on tickets.  Let's first find how much they spent on food.  The problem says they spent 4. 50 less on food than on the tickets, so they must have spent 20. 25 - 4. 50 = 15.  75 on food.   Now they spent 20.   25 on tickets and 15.   75 on food.   This makes the total spent 20.   25 + 15.  75 = 50.   75.    They then went on 2 rides for 33 dollars each.   2 x 33 = 66.    Total spent is 50 + 66 = 116.   116 is how much they spent in total, and they split it evenly among 3 friends. 116 / 3 = 38.  83.  The answer is 38. 
[EXP] 29: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]: 200 pounds of carrots are to be distributed. 40 restaurants are to receive 2 pounds each. 40 x 2 = 80 pounds. 200 - 80 = 120 pounds. 120 pounds will not be used.  The answer is 120 pounds. 
[EXP] 30: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 31, [output]:  Let's break down the cheese slices used:

* 3 omelets (1 slice of cheese per omelet, 1 more slice than per sandwich) = 3 x 3 = 9 slices
* 1 big dish of macaroni and cheese (8 slices)

Add all the slices: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31

The answer is 31. 
[EXP] 31: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Sara has 10 dollars initially.  For each babysiting job, she earns 5 dollars, so after 4 babysiting jobs, she saves 5 * 4 = 20 dollars.  She has 10 + 20 = 30 dollars.   Now, the jacket costs 30 dollars and 2 pairs of shoes cost 2 x 20 = 40 dollars.   So she needs 30 + 40 = 70 dollars total.   Since she has 30 dollars, she still needs 70 - 30 = 40 more dollars.   Mowing the lawn earns her 4 dollars each time.  So, to get 40 more dollars, she must mow the lawn 40 / 4 = 10 times.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 32: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 4 roses are in the vase. 7 more dahlias than roses means there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. 4 roses and 11 dahlias means there are 4 + 11 = 15 flowers in the vase in total.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 33: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 180, [output]:  Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour, and he uses it for 3 hours, so he will pay 30 * 3 = 90 dollars for the canoe rental.  Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour, and he uses it for 5 hours, so he will pay 18 * 5 = 90 dollars for the raft rental.  In total, they will pay 90 + 90 dollars, which is 180 dollars.  The answer is 180. 
[EXP] 34: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  On Monday, Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, who collects 20 shells.  So Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells.  If Kylie collects 2 times more shells on Tuesday, she collects 25 x 2 = 50 shells.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 35: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 68, [output]:  First, we find the age of Joan.  Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, who is 20 years old, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.  Then, Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.  Now we add up the ages: Jessa is 20, Joan is 25, and Mary is 23.  So the sum is 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.  The answer is 68. 
[EXP] 36: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 7, [output]: 32 - 4 = 28.  The difference between the number of snails is 28.  This is also said to be twice the amount of fish in both aquariums.  So the amount of fish in both aquariums is 28 / 2 = 14.  There are 14 fish in each aquarium.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 37: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 73, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step:

1.  Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.  So, in total, he killed 10 + 15 = 25 animals. 
2.  Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night.  Let's call the number of wolves killed today "w" and the number of cougars killed today "c".  We know that w = 3c, because he killed three times as many wolves as cougars.  He also killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so c = 15 - 3 = 12.  Putting this back into w = 3c, we find w = 36. 
3.   In total, he killed w + c = 36 + 12 = 48.   But this is for today.  We also have to add the 25 animals he killed yesterday.  So in total, he killed 48 + 25 = 73 animals.  The answer is 73. 
[EXP] 38: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 168, [output]:  This is a multi-step problem.  First, we need to find out how many apples Jamal has.  Andrea has 52 apples.  According to the problem, she has 8 more apples than Jamal.  So Jamal must have 52 - 8 = 44 apples. 

Second, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has.  The problem states that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.  So Jamal must have 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.  Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she must have 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.  Now we can find the total number of fruits.   There are 52 apples and 24 bananas, so there are 52 + 24 = 76 fruits in total.   The answer is 76. 
[EXP] 39: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 118000, [output]:  Mr.  Tan sold the house for $400,000.  He paid a transfer fee of 3%, which is 3% of $400,000 = 0. 03 x 400,000 = $12,000.  He also paid a brokerage fee of 5%, which is 5% of $400,000 = 0.  05 x 400,000 = $20,000.   To get his total costs, he adds the transfer fee and the brokerage fee, which is 12,000 + 20,000 = $32,000.  He also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount.  His total cost is $32,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.  To find his net proceeds, he subtracts his total cost from the selling price, which is 400,000 - 282,000 = $118,000.  The answer is $118,000. 
[EXP] 40: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 315, [output]: 1800 is the total number of stitches for the whole sweater. 900 of those stitches are for the body.  The collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.  The rosette takes 2 times that, which is 180 stitches.   So far we're at 900 (body) + 90 (collar) + 180 (rosette) = 1170 stitches.  There are 1800 stitches total, so the 2 sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches in total.  Each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.  The answer is 315. 
[EXP] 41: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]: 20 popsicles at 0. 25 each will be 20 x 0. 25 = 5 dollars.  4 ice cream bars at 0. 50 each will be 4 x 0. 50 = 2 dollars.  5 dollars + 2 dollars is 7 dollars.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 42: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 76 is the total number of stars on the flag.  There are three rows of 8 stars, so that is 8 x 3 = 24 stars.  There are two rows of 6 stars, so that is 6 x 2 = 12 stars.  Altogether we have 24 + 12 = 36 stars.  Since there are 76 stars in total, there are 76 - 36 = 40 remaining stars.  Each row has 5 stars, so we can find the number of rows by dividing 40 by 5. 40/5 is 8.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 43: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Will had 15 oranges.  The oldest son is 8 years old, and can wash 8 oranges.  The youngest son is half as old, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old, and can wash 4 oranges.  In total, they washed 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.  So 15 - 12 = 3 oranges are left unwashed.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 44: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 32 pages requires 16 sides of paper, because one side is used for each page. 16 sides of paper is equivalent to 8 full pieces of paper, because each piece has 2 sides. 8 pieces of paper are needed.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 45: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  A tub of ice cream originally costs 13 dollars and now is sold at 11 dollars. 13 - 11 = 2 dollars, so you will save 2 dollars per tub of ice cream. 2 tubs of ice cream will save you 2 x 2 = 4 dollars. 

A packet of milk was sold at a discount of 0. 5 dollars.  0. 5 is 50 cents. 4 packets of milk will save you 50 cents x 4 = 2 dollars. 

You will save 4 dollars on the tubs of ice cream and 2 dollars on the packets of milk.  4 + 2 is 6 dollars.  The answer is 6 dollars. 
[EXP] 46: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]: 2 families with 6 people each means there are 2 x 6 = 12 people. 3 families with 4 people each means there are 3 x 4 = 12 people.  Total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24. 8 people couldn't come, so 24 - 8 = 16 people are left.  1/4 of 8 is 2, which means 2 people had previous commitments, so 16 - 2 = 14 people show up.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 47: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Jam started with 2 loose pencils and got 3 boxes full of pencils.  In total, that is 3 x ? unknown-number-of-pencils + 2 = 26 pencils.  Let's find what 3 x unknown-number-of-pencils = ? That would mean we subtract 2 from both sides to get:

3 x unknown-number-of-pencils = 26 - 2
3 x unknown-number-of-pencils = 24
unknown-number-of-pencils = 24 / 3
unknown-number-of-pencils = 8

So, Jam had 8 pencils per box.  There are 3 boxes, so that is 3 x 8 = 24 pencils from the boxes.  Adding the 2 loose pencils, Jam has 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. 

Jam and Meg had 26 + 46 = 72 pencils in total.  If each box can hold 8 pencils, then Jam and Meg need ? unknown-number-of-boxes to store all their pencils.  Let's find what ? unknown-number-of-boxes would be:

? unknown-number-of-boxes x 8 = 72
unknown-number-of-boxes = 72 / 8
unknown-number-of-boxes = 9

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 48: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Erin had 7 lollipops initially.  Her mother gave her 10 more, so she had 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.  After Erin gave 3 to Ella, she had 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 49: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 72, [output]: 8 shares at $8 each costs 8 x 8 = 64 dollars.  The price increases 50%, so instead of being $8 each, each share is now $12 (8 x 1. 5 = 12).  So, the value of the shares is now 8 x 12 = 96 dollars.  In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%, so each share is now $9 (12 x 0. 75 = 9).   The value of the shares is now 8 x 9 = 72 dollars.   The answer is 72. 
[EXP] 50: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 180000, [output]: 5000 meters is the initial distance. 1/5 of 5000 is 1000. 1000 more means 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters. 6000 meters per day for a month of 30 days is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters. 180,000 meters in total.  The answer is 180,000.

3.  Wednesday: 1/2 hour cheese-tasting event = 0. 5 hours
4.  Thursday: 3 hours of cooking class / 2 = 1. 5 hours
5.   Friday: 2 hours of errands

Adding up all the hours, we get:
1 + 3 + 0. 5 + 1. 5 + 2 = 8

The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 52: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Morgan's dad gave her a budget of 90 dollars.  She wants to play mini-golf once, which is 5 dollars.  She also wants 5 dollars in arcade tokens, and she wants to ride go-karts twice, which is 10 x 2 = 20 dollars.  Totaling up the costs, 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 dollars.   That leaves her with 90 - 30 = 60 dollars.  To find out how many friends she can invite, we can divide 60 by 5 dollars per friend, since 5 dollars is the cost for each round of mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts.  60 ÷ 5 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 53: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 49, [output]: 96 fourth-graders were at the school.  43 of them were girls, so 96 - 43 = 53 of them were boys.  On Friday, 4 boys and 5 girls were absent.  So, 4 boys were absent out of 53 boys, which leaves 53 - 4 = 49 boys at school.  The answer is 49. 
[EXP] 54: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 14 pairs of tennis shoes were sold on Friday. 14 is the base number.  On the next day, they sold double that number.  So, 14 * 2 = 28.  Now, in total they sold 14 + 28 = 42.  On the last day, they sold one-half the amount sold on the previous day.  So, 28 / 2 = 14.  But then, 6 people returned their shoes, so actually, 14 - 6 = 8.   Adding this to the previous total, we get 42 + 8 = 50.  The answer is 50 pairs of tennis shoes. 
[EXP] 55: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 50 socks need washing.  10 pairs means 10 x 2 = 20 socks were washed.  15 loose socks were also washed.  20 + 15 = 35 socks were washed in total.  Originally, there were 50 socks, and 35 socks were washed. 50 - 35 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 56: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]: 52 people are originally in the choir.  50% are boys and 50% are girls, so half of 52 is 26, so there are 26 boys and 26 girls.  The choir decides to perform only with girls, so there are 26 girls.   However, half of them can't make it to the show, so 26 / 2 = 13 can't make it.   That leaves 26 - 13 = 13 girls who can perform.  The choir's 3 teachers also join them, so there are 13 + 3 = 16 people singing.   The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 57: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]:  Since Netflix is $10, that's the first cost.  For Hulu and Disney Plus, bundling gives a 20% discount, so we calculate the full price and then subtract 20%.  The full price is 10 + 10 = 20.  20% of 20 is 20/100 * 20 = 4.  So the full price minus the discount is 20 - 4 = 16.  Now we add all of these costs to get 10 + 16 = 26.  Tim used to pay $60 for his cable.   So by switching, he is saving 60 - 26 = 34 dollars.  The answer is 34. 
[EXP] 58: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  We can start with the fact that Erica is 30 years old.  Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old.  Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old.  The difference in their ages is the difference between 42 and 30, which is 42 - 30 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 59: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 200, [output]:  Since Allan has 40 cannolis originally, and he has twice as much corn as cannolis, he must have 40 x 2 = 80 corns originally.  

Then he bought 60 more cannolis, which makes a total of 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.  He also bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis, so he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.  Then he had 80 corns initially, and bought 60 more, so he had a total of 80 + 60 = 140 corns. 

In total, Allan has 140 corns and 100 cannolis.   The combined total is 140 + 100 = 240.  The answer is 240. 
[EXP] 60: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]: 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.  A percentage is the same as a decimal multiplied by 100.  So 5% is the same as . 05. 05 * 50000 = 2500, which means 2500 candles will smell like wet dog. 

Marcy says they are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% will explode.  1% is the same as . 01.  01 * 50000 = 500, which means 500 candles will explode.  However, we want to know how many will both explode and smell like wet dog.   We have already found that 2500 candles will smell like wet dog.   Of those 2500, 1% will explode. 01 * 2500 = 25.  Therefore, 25 of the candles that smell like wet dog will also explode.   The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 61: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17000, [output]:  Mr.  Josue started with 5000 dollars.  The first bank gave him 4000 dollars, so he has 5000 + 4000 = 9000 dollars.  The second bank gave him twice as much as the first, so they gave him 4000 * 2 = 8000 dollars.  Adding that to his total, he has 9000 + 8000 = 17000 dollars.  The answer is 17000. 
[EXP] 62: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 150, [output]:  Kenny has $50 after going to the amusement park.  He kept 1/3 of the cards, and he got $50 in cash from selling them.  

Let's say he had x cards.   Then, (2/3) * x = the number of cards he sold. 

The total money he got from selling cards is (2/3) * x * $1. 50, and this money is equal to $50. 

(2/3) * x * $1. 50 = $50 

x = ($50) * 3 / 1. 5 = $100 

So Kenny had 100 cards to start.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 63: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 5 dollars are originally, and after spending, George has 1% of it: 1% of 5 = 0. 05 0. 05 * 100 = 5 cents.  

Originally, George had 5 * 100 cents = 500 cents.  He has 5 cents left.  So the money he spent is 500 - 5 = 495 cents. 

Chips cost 40 cents each, and he bought 3 bags, so he spent 3 * 40 = 120 cents on chips.  That leaves 495 - 120 = 375 cents, which is spent on candy bars.  

Each candy bar costs 75 cents.  To find how many candy bars he bought, we can divide the money spent on candy bars by how much each candy bar costs.  375 / 75 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 64: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Let's find the total number of beads each sister has.  Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads, and each pack of beads has 20 pieces, so Elizabeth bought 1 x 20 + 2 x 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 beads.  Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads, each with 20 pieces.   So Margareth bought 3 x 20 + 4 x 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 beads.   The difference between 140 and 60 is 80.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 65: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 539, [output]:  The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576.  He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each on Monday, which is 17 x 20 = 340 dollars.  He sold the rest of the sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) to the department store for $25 each.  So, the amount he received from the department store is 31 x 25 = 775 dollars.  In total, he received 340 + 775 = 1115 dollars.  The amount he spent on buying the sneakers was $576.  So, his profit is 1115 - 576 = 539 dollars.  The answer is 539. 
[EXP] 66: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1920, [output]:  Each raised bed is 2 x 8 x 2 = 32 cubic feet. 10 raised beds will require 10 x 32 = 320 cubic feet.  Each bag holds 2 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = 160 bags of potting soil. 160 bags * $12 per bag = $1920.  The answer is $1920. 
[EXP] 67: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 71, [output]:  Ali started with 21 dollars.  Leila gave him half of her 100 dollars.  Ali received 100 ÷ 2 = 50 dollars.   So Ali has 21 + 50 = 71 dollars now.  The answer is 71. 
[EXP] 68: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 6 jars of sprinkles with 8 cupcakes each per jar is 6 x 8 = 48 cupcakes. 48 cupcakes split into pans of 12 cupcakes is 48 / 12 = 4 pans. 4 pans worth of cupcakes will use up all the sprinkles.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 69: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Sarah spent $300 on books. 300 / 15 = 20. 20 books were bought.  She gave them equally to her 4 kids.  20 ÷ 4 = 5.  Each child got 5 books.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 70: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Gabriel has 20 songs on his media player.  Luri has 3 times as many. 3 x 20 = 60, so Luri has 60 songs.  Since Gabriel can add 80 more (100 - 20 = 80) and Luri can add 40 more (100 - 60 = 40), Luri can add 80 - 40 = 40 fewer songs.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 71: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 8-year-old has 4 dollars, so he needs 12 - 4 = 8 dollars more.  He saves 2 dollars daily. 8 / 2 is 4 days.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 72: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 112, [output]:  Paul drove 2 times a day for 14 days. 2 times per day is equal to 2 x 14 = 28.  Each morning he spent 6 dollars and each afternoon he spent 2 dollars.  So for each day, he spent 6 + 2 = 8 dollars, and for 14 days, that is 8 x 14 = 112 dollars.  The answer is 112. 
[EXP] 73: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that she paid a total of $7.  Let x be the cost of one pack of strawberry gum.   There are two packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost of both is 2x.  The cost of the green apple gum is half of $2, which is $1.  The cost of the grape gum is $2.  The total cost of all four packs is $7.  We can set up the following equation:

2x + 1 + 2 = 7

This becomes:

2x + 3 = 7

Subtract 3 from both sides:

2x = 4

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 2

So the cost of one pack of strawberry gum is $2.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 74: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 110, [output]:  Gerald gets paid 30 dollars every day, and he worked for an entire week which is 7 days.  So he earned 30 x 7 = 210 dollars.  But he spent 100 dollars total.  So he has 210 - 100 = 110 dollars left.  The answer is 110. 
[EXP] 75: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]:  Ali started with 4 x 10 = 40 dollars from the $10 bills. 6 x 20 = 120 dollars from the $20 bills. 40 + 120 = 160 dollars.  Half of that is 160/2 = 80 dollars, which Ali gave to her sister. 160 - 80 = 80 dollars left. 80 x 3/5 = 48 dollars used for dinner.  So Ali has 80 - 48 dollars left. 80 - 48 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 76: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 12, [output]: 27 cups of raisins were in the big bag. 3/4 cup of raisins is needed to make each batch of oatmeal cookies.  We can solve this problem by setting up a division problem: 27 ÷ 3/4 = ? 

We can invert the fraction to make it a multiplication problem: 27 * 4/3 = ?, then multiply by 4 and divide by 3: 

27 * 4 = 108, then 108 ÷ 3 = 36. 36 batches of oatmeal cookies can be made.  The answer is 36. 
[EXP] 77: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Jame will be 27 in 5 years.  That means he is currently 22 years old (27 - 5 = 22).  His cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years.  In 8 years, Jame will be 30 years old.  Twice his age is 30 x 2 = 60.  5 years younger than 60 is 60 - 5 = 55.  Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, which means his cousin is currently 47 years old (55 - 8 = 47).  To find the difference in their ages now, subtract 22 from 47.  47 - 22 is 25.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 78: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 35, [output]:  The total amount of the dinner bill is $50 and there is an additional 20% tip.  To find 20% of 50, multiply 20% (which is the same as 0. 20) by 50, so 0. 20 x 50 = 10.  50 + 10 = 60.   So the total amount is 60.  My wife wants to split the check equally, but I need to pay an additional 20% tip.  If my wife and I split 60, that would be 60/2 = 30.   But I have to pay 10 dollars more for the tip, so I need to pay 30 + 10 = 40.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 79: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 130, [output]:  Elise writes the alphabet all the way through twice, that is 26 + 26 = 52 letters.  Then, she writes half of the alphabet, which is 13 letters, so she adds 13 to 52, making 52 + 13 = 65.  She re-writes everything, which means she writes the 65 letters again, so that means she writes another 65 letters. 65 + 65 = 130.  So, Elise has written a total of 130 letters.  The answer is 130. 
[EXP] 80: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 92, [output]:  Bill started with 2 cases of water, and each has 24 bottles. 2 x 24 = 48.  He wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, so he will need 2 x 70 = 140 bottles of water in total.  But he already has 48, so he only needs 140 - 48 = 92 more bottles of water.  The answer is 92. 
[EXP] 81: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]: 3 cages have 10 hamsters, so there are 3 x 10 = 30 hamsters. 3 cages have 5 guinea pigs, so there are 3 x 5 = 15 guinea pigs.  In total, there are 30 + 15 = 45 rodents.  The answer is 45. 
[EXP] 82: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Let's break this problem into parts.  The tooth fairy left Sharon 5 dollars for the first tooth.   Then, for each of the next 3 teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon 1 dollar each.   That is 1 x 3 = 3 dollars.   Then, for the next 2 teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of the previous 3 teeth.   The previous 3 teeth were worth 1 dollar each, for a total of 3 dollars.   Half of 3 dollars is 1.  2 x 1 is 2.  So, the tooth fairy gave Sharon 2 dollars for the next 2 teeth.   In total, the tooth fairy left Sharon 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 dollars.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 83: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 37, [output]:  Let's break down the costs:

* Bread: 3 dollars per loaf, and 1 loaf makes 10 sandwiches. 10 sandwiches require 1 loaf, so the cost of bread is 3 dollars. 
* Cheese and condiments: 30 dollars per 10 sandwiches, so the cost per sandwich is 30 / 10 = 3 dollars. 
* Total cost per sandwich: 3 dollars for bread + 3 dollars for cheese and condiments = 6 dollars per sandwich. 

Revenue: 10 sandwiches for 7 dollars each = 10 x 7 = 70 dollars

Profit: revenue - total cost = 70 - (6 x 10) = 70 - 60 = 10

The net profit is 10 dollars.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 84: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 215, [output]:  First, let's convert the length of each movie into minutes.  The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1 x 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.  The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes, which is 2 x 60 + 5 = 125 minutes.   In total, Max will watch these movies for 90 + 125 minutes.  90 + 125 is 215.  The answer is 215. 
[EXP] 85: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 52, [output]: 1.  Jared started with 47 words per minute (WPM). 2.  After some lessons, his typing speed increased to 52 WPM.  This means it increased by 52 - 47 = 5 WPM.  So he increased by 5 WPM. 3.  Next time, he will increase his speed again by 5 WPM.  4.  So, his speed in that test is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM. 5.   To find the average of the three measurements, we add 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 and divide by 3, which is 52.  The answer is 52. 
[EXP] 86: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step!

Jerry is currently twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so if we let "x" be his current age, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives:

-x = -10

Adding 10 to both sides gives:

x = 10

So Jerry's current age is 10.  To find his age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.  The answer is 13. 
[EXP] 87: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Let's start by finding the rate at which the plane travels. 1200 miles in 3 hours is a rate of 1200/3 miles per hour. 1200/3 = 400 miles per hour.  To travel 2000 additional miles, the plane would need 2000/400 = 5 more hours.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 88: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]: 1/4 pound of butter is needed to make 1 dozen croissants. 4 dozen croissants will need 4 * (1/4) = 1 pound of butter. 

If he makes 4 dozen a day for a week, then that's 4 * 7 = 28 dozen croissants. 28 dozen croissants will need 28 * (1/4) = 7 pounds of butter.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 89: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step.  The beanstalk started at 3 inches and then doubled in the second week. 3 * 2 = 6.  So after the second week, the beanstalk was 6 inches tall.  Then it grew 4 inches in the third week. 6 + 4 = 10.   The beanstalk is 10 inches tall at the end of the third week.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 90: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years. 4 years from now would be 12 - 4 = 8 years. 8 years before she turns 16 would make her 16 - 8 = 8 years old.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 91: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 100 surfers ride the wave. 25% (or 1/4) of the riders can stay upright on the wave.  1/4 x 100 = 25.  So 25 surfers can stay upright.  Of these 25 surfers, 60% are women.  60% means 60 out of 100.  So, 60/100 x 25 = 15 women can stay upright.   That means the remaining 25 - 15 = 10 surfers are men.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 92: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]: 





Let's start with what we know:

* Paisley ran 4 miles.  Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.  Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.  So Lynn ran 17 miles.  The answer is 17. 
[EXP] 93: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 29, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

1.  Steve is 60 years old, and his wife is 4 years older than him.  So, his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.  Their son is half as old as his mom, who is 64.   So, their son is 64/2 = 32 years old. 
   Then, Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband.  Since the son is 32 years old, his wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old. 
   
   So, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.  The answer is 29. 
[EXP] 94: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2100, [output]: 400 was 1/2 of the amount earned from selling green hats.  Since 400 x 2 = 800 was earned from selling green hats, the total amount earned in the first month was 400 + 800 = 1200.  In the second month, Ariadne made 3/4 of 1200 which is 3/4 * 1200 = 900.  So the total amount earned in two months is 1200 + 900 = 2100.  The answer is 2100. 
[EXP] 95: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Let's start with the information given in the problem.  It takes Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.  Then it takes her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.  So, it takes her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.  Since beans take half the cooking time of pork and rice combined, we can find the time it takes to cook beans by first adding the cooking times of pork and rice and then dividing by 2:

50 (minutes for pork) + 30 (minutes for rice) = 80 minutes
80 / 2 = 40 minutes

Now, we add up the cooking times of all the ingredients:

30 (minutes for rice) + 50 (minutes for pork) + 40 (minutes for beans) = 120 minutes

So, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 96: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 360, [output]: 60% of 150 teachers are history teachers. 60% means 6/10 or 60/100.  To find 60% of 150, we can multiply 150 by 60/100.  150 * (60/100) = 90.  So 90 teachers are history teachers.  This leaves 150 - 90 = 60 teachers that are math teachers.  Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours, so the total number of hours they sleep is 60 teachers * 6 hours = 360 hours.   The answer is 360. 
[EXP] 97: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Christina had her first 8 days which were good.  Then she had her next 8 days which were bad.  The following 8 days were neutral.  So those were the first 24 days.  So far, there were 12 good days, 8 bad days.  The remaining number of days must be neutral.  30 - 24 = 6 days remaining.  We know that of those remaining 6 days, 3 were good.   So there are 12 + 3 = 15 good days in total.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 98: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 576, [output]: 6 potatoes makes 36 hash browns. 96 potatoes will make 96 / 6 times the amount. 96 / 6 is 16. 16 times 36 is 576. 576 hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes.  The answer is 576. 
[EXP] 99: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Greta baked 30 cookies.  Celinda baked twice as many as Greta.  Twice as many as 30 is 2 x 30 = 60.  So, together they baked 30 + 60 = 90.  Since they ate 10 of the cookies, they put 90 - 10 = 80 cookies in a box.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 100: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 68, [output]:  Let's start by using the given information to fill in the number of squares for each color:

* Red: 14
* Blue: 14 + 4 = 18
* Green: 18 + 6 = 24
* White: 24 - 12 = 12

Then, we can find the total number of squares by adding the number of squares for each color:

14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is the total number of squares multiplied by the area of one square:

68 x 1 square foot/square = 68 square feet

So, the comforter is 68 square feet.  The answer is 68. 
[EXP] 101: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 135, [output]: 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each means 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks in total. 40% of the city's fireworks are visible from Hannah's house.  40% of 300 is 40/100 * 300 = 120.  If Hannah sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, that is 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.  In total, Hannah will see 120 + 15 = 135 fireworks.  The answer is 135. 
[EXP] 102: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 100% is the total water from the Colorado River.  40% is used by the city.  80% of the city's water is used for industrial purposes.  So the remaining 20% is used for non-industrial purposes.  If 40% is used by the city, then 20% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.  The answer is 20%. 
[EXP] 103: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  James started with 20 dollars to go picking blueberries.  Then he paid $1. 5 per pound, and he picked 30 pounds.  So he paid 30 x 1. 5 = 45 dollars.   He spent a total of 20 + 45 = 65 dollars. 

If he wants to buy 30 pounds of blueberries at the store, it would cost him 30 x 2.  5 = 75 dollars. 

The amount he saved is 75 - 65 = 10.   He saved 10 dollars.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 104: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2450, [output]:  Let's first calculate the total number of taps with arms down.  Helga can tap 300 + 250 per minute, for a total of 550 taps, and she does that for 5 - 2 = 3 minutes. 3 x 550 = 1650 taps.  With her arms up, she taps at 200 + 200 taps per minute, for a total of 400 taps, and does that for 2 minutes. 2 x 400 = 800 taps.  Her total number of taps is 1650 + 800 = 2450.  The answer is 2450. 
[EXP] 105: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]: 15 + 45 = 60 is the total blue spools. 60 is a part of the total number of spools.  Let's find the total number of spools: 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150. 60 is what percentage of 150? We use the following technique: we divide 60 by 150 to find the part, and then multiply by 100: (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%.  The answer is 40%. 
[EXP] 106: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 20% of 100 voters is 20/100 * 100 = 20 voters. 50% more than 20 is 20 + (20 * 50%) = 20 + 10 = 30 voters.  Candidate B got 30 votes. 100 - 20 - 30 = 50 voters.  Candidate C got 50 votes.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 107: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]: 80 students in total are in both classes.  Let's break it down:

1.  Each class has the same number of students, so let's call it x. 
2.  The total number of students is the sum of both classes, so x + x = 80. 
3.  Simplify the equation: 2x = 80.  Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.  So each class has 40 students. 
4.   In each class, 40% of the students are girls.   What percent are boys?  The remaining percent is 100% - 40% = 60%. 
5.   In each class, 40% of 40 students are girls, which is 40% * 40 = 16.  The remaining students are boys.  There are 40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 108: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 3, [output]: 54 students need to be separated into 6 groups. 54 / 6 = 9.  So each group has 9 students.  The activity requires 12 groups.  To find how many more are needed, we need to subtract 6 from 12. 12 - 6 = 6.  So 6 more groups are needed to form.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 109: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]: 33 is the total number of people on the council.  If there are twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, let's say there were 'n' votes against and '2n' votes in favor. 

So, we have the equation:

n + 2n = 33

Combine like terms:

3n = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

n = 11

Now we know there were 11 votes against the new regulation.  If there are twice as many votes in favor as against, then there were:

2n = 2 * 11 = 22

So, there were 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.  The answer is 22. 
[EXP] 110: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

1. 250 cases of shingles are needed in total. 

2.  The first house needs 1/2 of the second house.  Let's represent the amount of shingles needed for the second house as "x".  Then the first house will need x/2. 

3.  The third house needs double the first house, which is 2(x/2) = x.  So the third house will need "x". 

4.   The sum of the amounts needed for the three houses is equal to the total, so: x + x/2 + x = 250. 

5.   Combining like terms, 3x/2 = 250. 

6.  Multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction, 3x = 500.  Then dividing both sides by 3, x = 500/3 = 166. 67.  Since we can't have a fraction of a case of shingles, we round down to the nearest whole number.   The second house needs 166 cases of shingles.  

7.   The first house needs half of that, which is 166/2 = 83.  The third house needs double the first house, which is 2 * 83 = 166.  The answer is 166. 
[EXP] 111: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents were available.  Vanilla sold 5 of each, so 5 * 4 = 20.  Fruity sold 2 of each, so 2 * 8 = 16.  The difference is 20 - 16 = 4.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 112: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4400, [output]: 600 movies are initially in Mike's collection.  A third (1/3) of the movies are in various series, so 600 / 3 = 200 movies.  200 movies are in series and so only cost 6 dollars each.   200 * 6 = 1200, so the cost of the series is 1200 dollars.   Of the remaining 600 - 200 = 400 movies, 40% (2/5) are older movies, which cost 5 dollars.   The fraction 2/5 is 40% because (2/5) x 100% = 40%.   So, 2/5 of 400 movies are older movies.   (2/5) * 400 = 160 movies.  These older movies cost 5 dollars each, so the cost is 5 x 160 = 800.    We have to calculate the cost of the remaining movies, the normal movies.    400 - 160 = 240 movies are left.    These movies cost 10 dollars each, so their cost is 240 * 10 = 2400.    We already calculated the cost of the series, the older movies, and now the normal movies, so we can add these costs to find the total cost: 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400.    The answer is 4400 dollars. 
[EXP] 113: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  We first need to figure out how many miles Andy drives in a week.  Since he goes to work 5 days a week, that means he goes 5 + 5 miles each way per day.  2 x 5 = 10 miles.   10 x 5 days = 50 miles.   Andy's car consumes 50 miles/(10 miles/gallon) = 5 gallons per week.  So how much does this cost?  5 gallons/week * 3 dollars/gallon = 15 dollars/week.   The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 114: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]: 172 people were originally on the train. 47 people get off, so now there are 172 - 47 = 125 people left. 13 people get on, so now there are 125 + 13 = 138 people. 38 people get off, so now there are 138 - 38 = 100 people.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 115: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Billy's starting salary is 10/hr.  After 2 months, it increased to 10 + 0. 50 = 10. 50/hr.   After another month, it increased again to 10. 50 + 1. 00 = 11. 50/hr.   Sally's starting salary is 0.  50 more than Billy's starting salary, so it's 10.  00 + 0.  50 = 10.  50/hr.   Billy worked 20 hours and Sally worked 20 hours as well.   Let's first find Billy's earnings.   Billy's hourly wage is 11.   50, so Billy's total earnings are 20 * 11.  50 = 230.  Sally's hourly wage is 10.   50, so Sally's total earnings are 20 * 10.  50 = 200.    Billy's earnings are 230 and Sally's earnings are 200, so Billy earned 230 - 200 = 30 more than Sally.    The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 116: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1170, [output]:  James has to pay the cost of the diamond, which is 600, the cost of the gold, which is 300, and a 30% premium on this total.  To find the premium, multiply the cost of the diamond and gold together (600 + 300 = 900) and then multiply that by the percentage of the premium (30/100 = 0. 3) and then add it to the cost of the diamond and gold.  That would look like this: 900 * 0. 3 = 270 and 900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
[EXP] 117: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 79, [output]: 1) First, Rose picks flowers with 5 petals each.  She picks 3 flowers, so the total number of petals is 3 * 5 = 15.  2) Then she picks flowers with 6 petals each.  She picks 4 flowers, so the total number of petals is 4 * 6 = 24.  3) Next, she picks flowers with 4 petals each.  She picks 5 flowers, so the total number of petals is 5 * 4 = 20.   4) After that, she picks flowers with 7 petals each.   She picks 6 flowers, so the total number of petals is 6 * 7 = 42. 

Now, she drops one flower with 5 petals, one flower with 6 petals, one flower with 4 petals, and one flower with 7 petals.   So she loses 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals.  She has 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 - 22 petals left. 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 is 101.   101 - 22 is 79.   The answer is 79. 
[EXP] 118: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 6,250, [output]: 20 students are working together. 50,000 is already raised from organizations.  So, the amount raised by the students is 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000.  Each student raised the same amount, so the amount each student raised is 125,000 / 20 = 6250.  The answer is 6250. 
[EXP] 119: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]: 5 green eggs.  Twice as many blue eggs as green eggs would be 2 x 5 = 10 blue eggs.  One fewer pink egg than blue eggs would be 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  One-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs would be 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.   The total number of eggs Cindy had is 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27.  The answer is 27.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, which is 4 feet.  Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, which is 40 feet.  Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.  The answer is 40 feet. 
[EXP] 121: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's solve this problem step by step!.  The total number of millimeters left is calculated by adding the remaining millimeters from each glue stick.  For the glue stick with 1/6 left, that means 5/6 of the glue stick is used.  5/6 * 12 = 10 millimeters are used, leaving 2 millimeters left.  For the glue stick with 2/3 left, that means 1/3 of the glue stick is used.  1/3 * 12 = 4 millimeters are used, leaving 8 millimeters left.   For the glue stick with 1/2 left, that means 1/2 is used, so 6 millimeters are used, leaving 6 millimeters left.  Adding all together, the total millimeters left is 2 + 8 + 6 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 122: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 975, [output]:  Brenda started with 300 dollars.  Each year, the amount she has increases by 3/4 * 300 = 225 dollars.  After 1 year, she will have 300 + 225 = 525 dollars.  After 2 years, she will have 525 + 225 = 750 dollars.  After 3 years, she will have 750 + 225 = 975 dollars.  So she will have 975 dollars after 3 years.  The answer is 975. 
[EXP] 123: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 144, [output]: 12 homes will be built in the first year.  In the next year, they will build 12 x 3 = 36 homes.  In the third year, they will double the number of homes they have built.  12 + 36 = 48.  Then double 48 is 96.  12 + 36 + 96 = 144.  The answer is 144. 
[EXP] 124: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  Claire earns 1 badge a month.  That's 12 badges per year.  Amber takes twice as long, so she earns 1/2 badge a month.   That's 6 badges a year.   Wendy earns 3 times the badges as Claire, which is 3 * 12 = 36 badges per year.  To find how many more badges Wendy earns than Amber, you subtract: 36 - 6 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 125: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  First, we need to find out how many jello cups Greg will need in total.  There will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 cups of jello.  30 x 4 = 120.   There are 10 jello cups in each box of jello.  To find the number of boxes he needs, divide 120 by 10.  120 divided by 10 is 12.  So he needs 12 boxes of jello.   12 boxes of jello will cost 12 x 1. 25 = 15$.  The answer is \$15. 
[EXP] 126: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  Paul started with 52 marbles.  His friend gave him 28 marbles, so he now has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.  Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles, which is 80 / 4 = 20 marbles. 80 - 20 is 60.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 127: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Kelly's budget is $65.  The 5 packs of bacon cost $10, and it’s worth knowing that a pack of bacon is $2.  A pack of chicken is twice that, so 2 x $2 = $4.  She has 6 packs of chicken, so 6 x $4 = $24.   The 3 packs of strawberries are $4 each, so 3 x $4 = $12.  A pack of apples is half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $2.  She has 7 packs of apples, so 7 x $2 = $14.  Adding all this up, we get $10 for the bacon, $24 for the chicken, $12 for the strawberries, and $14 for the apples, which is a total of $60.  $65 - $60 is $5, so she has $5 left in her budget.  The answer is 5.

[EXP] 129: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 250, [output]:  John rents the car 10 times a month for 3 hours each. 10 x 3 = 30 hours.  If he gets paid $25 an hour, he makes 30 x 25 = 750 dollars.  His car payment is $500, so his profit is 750 - 500 = 250.  The answer is 250. 
[EXP] 130: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]: 4 small masks with 2 yards of material means that each yard makes 4/2 = 2 small masks.  So, to make 20 small masks, we need 20/2 = 10 yards of material. 

For large masks, 2. 25 yards of material makes 3 large masks, so each yard makes 3/2. 25 = 4/3 large masks.  To make 8 large masks, we need 8/(4/3) = 8*3/4 = 6 yards of material.  Now, to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we need 10 + 6 = 16 yards of material.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 131: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 700, [output]:  First, we need to find out how many acres Farmer Smith's farm has.  If Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, and Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that, that means Farmer Smith's farm is 2 * 200 + 100 acres, which is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.  So now we know that Farmer Brown's farm has 200 acres and Farmer Smith's farm has 500 acres.  To find the total, we add them together: 200 + 500 = 700 acres.  The answer is 700. 
[EXP] 132: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Kira originally had 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges.  So she had 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 pieces of fruit in total.  After Lola ate 2 pieces, Kira had 14 - 2 = 12 pieces of fruit left.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 133: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 24 berries in 8 hours means the sloth needs to have 24 berries at some point during the trip.  But since it takes him 4 hours to make a trip, he actually makes 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.  Each trip, he can pick up a certain amount of berries.  Let's call this number x.  So in total, he picks 2 x berries in 8 hours.  But we know he picked 24 berries in 8 hours, so 2 x = 24.  This means x = 24/2 = 12.  So the sloth picks up 12 berries on each trip down the tree.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's start with what we know: the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100.  Let's represent the age of John as J.  Paul is 10 years older than John, so Paul's age is J + 10.   Since Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, we can write an equation: Peter's age = Paul's age + John's age = (J + 10) + J.  Now we can represent Peter's age as 2J + 10.   The combined age of the three of them is 100, so we can write another equation: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.   Combining the J's, we get 4J + 20 = 100.  Now let's subtract 20 from both sides to get 4J = 80.  Finally, let's divide both sides by 4 to get J = 20.  Now we know John's age is 20.  Since Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul is 20 + 10 = 30.  And Peter's age is 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 135: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 1.  John earns 50 dollars an hour, and he worked 6 hours, so he earns 50*6 = 300 dollars.  2.  He spends 50 dollars on gas.  So he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.  He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left.  3.  He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each.  So the pencils cost 5 * 10 = 50 dollars, leaving him with 150 - 50 = 100 dollars.  4.  He can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens with the remaining 100 dollars.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 136: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]:  James has to swim 20 miles, but he only swims 60% of that, which is 20 x 0. 6 = 12.  Since he swims at 2 miles per hour, it took him 12 / 2 = 6 hours to swim 12 miles.  Then he rests for half as long, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.  After resting, he has to swim the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.   At half his original speed, he swims at 1 mile per hour.   So it takes him 8 / 1 = 8 hours to swim the remaining distance.   In total, it took James 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours to get across the lake.  The answer is 17. 
[EXP] 137: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 360, [output]: //*[From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, there are 3 hours. 3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.  There are 180 minutes. ]*

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.  To find out how many times he can staple, divide 180 minutes by 15 minutes/batch, or 180 / 15 = 12.  So he can staple 12 batches. 

Vince staples 30 reports in every batch.  So he can staple 12 x 30 reports. 

12 * 30 = 360.  The answer is 360. 
[EXP] 138: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Coach brought one bag filled with basketballs.  Then the three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip.  Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey.  So let's say Jeffrey carried x, Jason carried 2x, and Jordan carried 4x.   Since there were only 1 bag of balls, Jason, Jordan, and Jeffrey must have carried all the balls by adding x + 2x + 4x = 7x.   But we know Jason carried 2 balls.  So 2x = 2 and x = 1.   x = 1 means Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried 2 balls, and Jordan carried 4 balls.  The total number of balls is the total number carried by all three boys.   1 + 2 + 4 = 7.   The coach started with 7 balls originally, x + 2x + 4x = 7x.  The answer is 7.

Roses need 1 pound each, carnations need 1. 5 pounds, and sunflowers need 3. 4 x 3 = 12 pounds for sunflowers, and 10 x 1. 5 = 15 pounds for carnations.  12 + 15 = 27.  30 - 27 = 3.  So that's 3 pounds left over for roses.  3 / 1 = 3.  They can plant 3 roses.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 143: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Tobias's howl is 20 seconds.  Chikote's howl is 2 times longer, so it is 20 x 2 = 40 seconds.   Igneous howls for as long as the other two combined.  Tobias's howl is 20 seconds, and Chikote's howl is 40 seconds, so the other two combined is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  Since Igneous howls for as long as the other two combined, his howl is 60 seconds.  Now, we add up all the howls: Tobias's 20 seconds, Chikote's 40 seconds, and Igneous's 60 seconds.  20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.  To convert to minutes, divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2.  The answer is 2 minutes. 
[EXP] 144: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  To solve this problem, we have to first find out how much total time it will take Jordan to make the cake.  

Jordan will spend 20 minutes on the cake batter, 30 minutes baking, 2 hours cooling, and 10 minutes frosting.  So the total time is: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes = 3 hours. 

If she wants to be ready to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, and the cake takes 3 hours to make, she should start making it at 2:00 pm at the latest.  If she starts making it later, she won't be ready by 5:00 pm.  The answer is 2:00 pm. 
[EXP] 145: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 230, [output]: 4 hours of traveling at 55 miles per hour means Matteo traveled 4 x 55 = 220 miles. 10 hours of traveling at 45 miles per hour means Shandy traveled 10 x 45 = 450 miles. 450 - 220 is 230.  The answer is 230. 
[EXP] 146: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 78, [output]:  Anne started with a box of sweets that contains 15 packs. 15 packs * 60 pieces/pack is 900 pieces in total.  She kept 2 packs for herself. 900 - 2 * 60 = 900 - 120 = 780.   She gave this to her 10 friends equally. 780 / 10 is 78.   The answer is 78. 
[EXP] 147: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 1.  First, let's find the price of large stuffed animals.  If there are 3 times the price of small ones, and a small one costs $4, then a large one costs $4 x 3 = $12.  2.  Let's say x is the number of small stuffed animals.  Then, the number of large stuffed animals is half of x, since she sold twice as many small ones as large ones.  So, the number of large stuffed animals is x / 2. 3.  The total amount earned is $120.   This is the sum of the money earned from the small and large stuffed animals.   So, the equation is:  4 * x + 12 * (x / 2) = 120  4 * x + 6 * x = 120  10 * x = 120  x = 12.  She sold 12 small stuffed animals.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 148: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]:  Let's start by calculating how many red balloons burst: 40% of 25 is 0. 4 x 25 = 10.  So 10 red balloons burst.  

Now Sally has 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left. 
Sally still has all her green balloons, which is 7.  
The number of yellow balloons Sally released is 12 / 2 = 6.  So she has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.   
Sally found 8 blue balloons. 75% of the blue balloons are 0. 75 x 8 = 6.  So she added 6 blue balloons to her collection.   
Then, she had her remaining red, green, and yellow balloons: 15 + 7 + 6 = 28.   Plus, the 6 blue balloons, that's 28 + 6 = 34.   The answer is 34. 
[EXP] 149: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 40 apples are in one box, so two boxes have 40 * 2 = 80 apples. 80 apples are divided into packs of 8 apples. 80 / 8 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 150: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 130000, [output]: 26 countries. 26 * 5 cities = 130 cities.  Each city had 1000 people.  130 * 1000 = 130000.  The answer is 130000.

[EXP] 153: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 247, [output]:  We will solve this problem step by step.  

On Monday, 32 classes visited the Science Center.  32 classes visited on Monday. 

On Tuesday, twice as many visited.  2 x 32 is 64.   So 64 classes visited on Tuesday. 

On Wednesday, three times as many visited.   3 x 32 is 96.   So 96 classes visited on Wednesday. 

On Thursday, 30 classes visited.  And on Friday, 25 classes visited.  So 30 + 25 = 55 classes visited on those two days. 55 classes visited on Thursday and Friday together.  

Total classes visited is the sum of the classes that visited on each day.   We must add 32 (Monday) + 64 (Tuesday) + 96 (Wednesday) + 55 (Thursday and Friday) = 247 classes visited the Science Center.  The answer is 247. 
[EXP] 154: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 251, [output]:  First, we need to find how many guests Kayla invited, excluding herself. 25 classmates + 7 girls in her dance class + 13 family members = 45 guests.  Since 4 people said they could not come, there were 45 - 4 = 41 people attending the party.   There are 20 people included in the original fee of $125, so there are 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests.  The additional fee is 6 dollars per guest, so the total additional fee is 21 x 6 = 126.  So the total cost is 125 + 126 = 251 dollars.   The answer is 251. 
[EXP] 155: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Melanie has already saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks, so she has 10 x 12 = 120 toothpicks.  200 toothpicks are required, so she needs 200 - 120 = 80 more toothpicks.  If she saves 10 toothpicks each week, it will take her 80 / 10 = 8 weeks more.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 156: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]: 8 inches in 4 years.  So it grows 8 / 4 = 2 inches per year.  In 13 years, it would grow 2 * 13 = 26 inches.  The answer is 26. 
[EXP] 157: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1080, [output]:  Let's work backwards.  A group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat.  But they didn't eat all the leftovers - they only ate the very last bit, which was half of what the velociraptors had left.  So the velociraptors must have left 540 kilograms.  But they didn't eat all the leftovers either - they only ate half of what the T-Rex left.  So the T-Rex must have left 1080 kilograms.   But when the T-Rex left, it had eaten half of the triceratops.  So before the T-Rex ate, the triceratops must have had 2160 kilograms of meat.  The answer is 2160. 
[EXP] 158: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  The people slide 60 feet per minute on the biggest slide.  They slide 300 feet.  The amount of time it takes to slide the whole slide is 300 / 60 = 5 minutes.  On the second slide, they go 80 feet per minute, and slide 240 feet.  The amount of time it takes is 240 / 80 = 3 minutes.  So the bigger slide takes 5 - 3 = 2 minutes longer than the smaller slide.  The answer is 2 minutes. 
[EXP] 159: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 100 centimeters must be cut into 4 equal parts, so the length of each part is 100 / 4 = 25. 25 centimeters is then divided into 5 equal parts, so the length of each piece is 25 / 5 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 160: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: -3, [output]: 2 degrees Celsius is the original temperature.  It dropped 8 degrees Celsius, so the new temperature is 2 - 8 = -6.  Then it increased 3 degrees Celsius, so the final temperature is -6 + 3 = -3.  The answer is -3. 
[EXP] 161: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 560, [output]:  John visits his parents twice a month, so he makes 2 round trips a month. 

For each round trip, the distance is 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph, so the distance is 2 hours x 70 mph = 140 miles. 

For 2 round trips, the total distance is 2 x 140 = 280 miles.  The answer is 280. 
[EXP] 162: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 750, [output]:  Since the average car can go 120 mph, the 2nd fastest car can go 120 * 5 = 600 mph.

[EXP] 164: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Chester will eat 3 eggs per day for 30 days, so he will eat a total of 3 x 30 = 90 eggs.  Then he will eat 5 eggs per day for another 30 days, so he will eat another 5 x 30 = 150 eggs.  In total, he will eat 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.  To find how many dozens of eggs he will need, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen). 240 / 12 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 165: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]: 3 dozen eggs is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.  If each child receives the same number, divide 36 by 4 children. 36 / 4 = 9.  The answer is 9.

If Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, then she gave 1/5 of her money to her sister.  1/5 of 15 is 3.  So Rissa gave 3 dollars.  Ronnie also gave 3 dollars.   Ronnie had 5 dollars, so after giving 3 dollars, he has 5 - 3 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 169: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 20 percent of the 5 inches is 5 * 0. 20 = 1.  The teacher has a total of 5 - 1 = 4 inches left.  He started with 45 percent gone.  To go from 45 to 20 percent, he has to lose 25%.  If he loses 1 inch after 1 day, it will take 4 days for him to lose 4 inches.  On the 4th day, the teacher will have to recycle his chalk.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 170: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 11, [output]: 2 apples fell out of the tree initially.  Newton picked up the 2 apples and put 1 in his pocket.  That leaves 1 apple left.   He threw that apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.   He picked up 5 apples and put all but one in his pocket.   He has 5 - 1 = 4 apples in his pocket and 1 remaining.   Then, he threw 1 more apple at the tree and 6 more apples fell out.   He picked up all the remaining apples at this point.  So in total, he picked up 4 apples from the ground, 1 apple from the tree, and 6 apples from the ground for a total of 4 + 1 + 6 = 11 apples.  The answer is 11. 
[EXP] 171: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 19, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 50 more (1 bulk pack).  That means they had 38 + 50 = 88 bandages at the end of the first day. 

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.  They didn't order any more bandages on this day, so they had 88 - 28 = 60 bandages left. 

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 x 50 = 100 bandages.  They only used half of this, so they used 50 bandages.   At the end of the day, they had 60 - 50 + 50 = 60 bandages left.  

We are told that they had 78 bandages left.   The previous day, they had 60 bandages, so 78 - 60 = 18 bandages came from the ordered bandages.  These are 50 - 32 = 18 bandages that they didn't use.  

They added these unused bandages to the bandages they started with on the first day. 88 + 18 = 106.    Therefore, they started with 106 bandages on the first day.  The answer is 106. 
[EXP] 172: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2400, [output]:  John starts with a base price of 600 dollars for 10 bottles of scotch.  For each bottle of scotch, he paid 600 / 10 = 60 dollars.  The total cost of 10 bottles is 60 * 10 = 600 dollars.  For the cognac, he buys 2 times 10 = 20 bottles.  The price is 50% more than the scotch, so 50% of 60 is 30, so the price of cognac is 60 + 30 = 90.  The 20 bottles of cognac will cost 20 * 90 = 1800 dollars.   In total, he spends 600 + 1800 = 2400 dollars.  The answer is 2400. 
[EXP] 173: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 168, [output]: 700 shells were originally found.  40% of 700 is 0. 4 x 700 = 280 shells.  That's what Team Alphas found.  The remaining shells are 700 - 280 = 420.  Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 0. 6 x 420 = 252 shells.  That's what Team The finders found.  The rest of the shells, or 420 - 252 = 168 shells, were found by Team Gogetters.  The answer is 168. 
[EXP] 174: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 448, [output]: 3 times that amount of the second medicine means 3 x 14 = 42 mL. 14 + 42 = 56 mL in one dosage. 8 doses would be 8 * 56 = 448.  The answer is 448. 
[EXP] 175: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 225, [output]:  In this problem, we are trying to find the total time it will take for all 70 students (10 students in each grade from 4 to 7) to try the escape room. 

First, let's find the number of groups: 70 students / 8 students per group = 8. 75 groups.  Since you can't have a fraction of a group, we round up to 9 groups. 

The time it takes for each group to try the escape room is 45 minutes.  The time it takes for all 9 groups to try the escape room is:

9 groups x 45 minutes per group = 405 minutes

To convert this from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

405 minutes / 60 = 6. 75 hours

The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 176: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Let's start by letting x be the number of cupcakes Carly made.  We know she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so the number of brownies she makes is 3x - 2. 

 Since each person gets two treats and there are 5 people in her class, Carly made a total of 5 x 2 = 10 treats. 

We know the total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies: x + (3x - 2) = 10

Combine like terms: 4x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4: x = 3

So Carly made 3 cupcakes.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 177: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 20 pieces of pomelos originally
After giving to her friend, she has 1/4 of the original pomelos, which means she has 20 / 4 = 5 pomelos left. 20 - 5 = 15 pomelos were given away
The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 178: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 1.  First, we can find out how many minutes it takes to clean all the classrooms.  It takes 15 minutes per classroom.  There are 80 classrooms, so it will take 80 x 15 = 1200 minutes altogether.  

2.  Next, we can find out the total number of minutes in an 8-hour day.  8 hours x 60 minutes per hour = 480 minutes.  So an 8 hour day is 480 minutes long.  The custodian's goal is to clean all the classrooms in 5 days, so they have 5 x 480 = 2400 minutes in total.  But only a part of that time goes to cleaning classrooms.  The number we are looking for is the part of the day spent cleaning classrooms, expressed as a percentage.  To find this, we can divide the time spent cleaning classrooms (1200 minutes) by the total time available (2400 minutes) and multiply by 100.   The calculation is:

(1200 minutes divided by 2400 minutes) x 100 = 50%

So the custodian will spend an average of 50% of their day cleaning classrooms.  The answer is 50%. 
[EXP] 179: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3360, [output]:  Ara has played a total number of 4 years. 4 years * 40 games per year = 160 games. 160 games * 21 points per game = 3360 points.  The answer is 3360. 
[EXP] 180: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]: 15 minutes per call * 60 minutes per hour = 90 minutes per hour.  If Tim works 6 hours a day, he deals with 6 * 60 = 360 minutes total.  360 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.  Since he works for 5 days, he deals with 24 * 5 = 120 calls in one week.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 181: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 210 photos need to be uploaded in total. 6 batches every day means 6 * 7 = 42 photos are uploaded each day. 210 / 42 = 5, with a remainder of 0.  So it will take Jade 5 days to upload all of her photos.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 182: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 40, [output]: 2-legged animals have 2 legs each, and there are 10 of them, so 10 * 2 = 20 legs. 4-legged animals have 4 legs each, and there are 15 of them, so 15 * 4 = 60 legs. 20 + 60 = 80. 80 legs.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 183: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 38, [output]:  First, let's figure out how much the tickets cost.  There are 2 adults and 1 child, so they spent 2 * 12 = 24 dollars on adult tickets and 8 dollars on the child ticket.  That's a total of 24 + 8 = 32 dollars for the tickets.  Then, the popcorns cost 2 * 3 = 6 dollars.  So in total, they pay 32 + 6 = 38 dollars.  The answer is 38. 
[EXP] 184: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Dexter started with 300 pounds of feed.  Each pig eats 4 pounds twice a day, so each pig eats 4 x 2 = 8 pounds per day.  Since there are 5 pigs, the total amount eaten per day is 5 x 8 = 40 pounds.  Since this goes on for 7 days, the total amount eaten is 40 x 7 = 280 pounds.   After eating 280 pounds, he will be left with 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 185: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 34, [output]: 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening makes 30 minutes each day.  Charisma does this for 7 days of the week.  So, she spends 30 * 7 = 210 minutes a week on meditation.  She also does 1 hour or 60 minutes of yoga 5 days a week.  That is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes a week.  In total, she spends 210 + 300 = 510 minutes a week.  In 4 weeks, she spends 510 * 4 = 2040 minutes.  The answer is 2040. 
[EXP] 186: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Ryan's allowance is 6 dollars per week. 3 weeks multiplied by 6 is 3 * 6 = 18. 18 dollars in total.  Ryan bought 4 ice cream cones at 1. 25 each. 4 * 1. 25 is 5. 00.  So the ice cream cones cost him 5. 00.  Now he has 18 - 5 = 13 dollars left.  The movie tickets cost 6.  50 each.   13 divided by 6.  50 is 2 with a remainder of 1.   Ryan can buy 2 tickets.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 187: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 72, [output]:  Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers.  12 can be divided into two halves: 6 and 6.  Matthew will get $5 for each of 6 toy soldiers, so that will be 5 * 6 = $30.  He will get $7 for each of the other 6 toy soldiers, so that will be 7 * 6 = $42.  In total, he will get $30 + $42 = $72.  The answer is $72. 
[EXP] 188: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2280, [output]:  Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430, means Kim raises 430 + 320 = 750.  Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300, means Maryam raises 300 + 400 = 700.  So in total, they raised 430 + 750 + 700 + 300 = 2180.  The answer is 2180. 
[EXP] 189: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 230, [output]:  First, let's calculate the discount: 100% - 80% = 20%.  80% off of $400 means the cost is $400 - (0. 8 x $400) = $400 - $320 = $80.   The radiator now costs $80, so Mark has to pay $80 for the radiator.   Mark also pays the mechanic $50 an hour for 3 hours.   The mechanic will charge 3 x $50 = $150.  In total, Mark has to pay $80 + $150 = $230.  The answer is 230.
