[EXP] 13: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  The football team played 22 games.  Let's say they lost x games.  Then they won 8 more than they lost, so they won x + 8 games. 

The total number of games they played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

So they lost 7 games.  Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won 7 + 8 = 15 games. 

The answer is 15. 
 Let's say the team lost x games.  Then they won 8 more than they lost, so they won x + 8 games.  The total number of games played is 22, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 8) = 22.  Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 8 = 22.  Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us 2x = 14.  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = 7.  So the team lost 7 games.  To find the number of games they won, we add 8 to 7, which gives us 15.  The answer is 15. 
 Let's say the number of games they lost is x. 

Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8. 

The total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the number of games they won and the number of games they lost:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So, they lost 7 games.  If they lost 7 games, they won 7 + 8 = 15 games. 

The answer is 15. 
 The football team played 22 games in total.  They won 8 more than they lost.  So let's say they lost x games.  Then they won x + 8 games.  The total is 22, so the equation is x + (x + 8) = 22.  We can simplify this to 2x + 8 = 22.  Subtracting 8 from both sides gives 2x = 14.  Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 7.  So they lost 7 games.  And they won 7 + 8 = 15 games.  The answer is 15. 
22 games in total, and they won 8 more than they lost.  Let's use "x" to represent the number of games they lost.  Then the number of games they won would be "x + 8". 

We know that the total number of games is the sum of the number of games they won and the number of games they lost, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So the team lost 7 games.  Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won:

7 + 8 = 15

games.  The answer is 15. 
 Let's start by saying that let's say the number of games they lost is x.  Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won x + 8 games. 

The team played a total of 22 games, so the number of games they won plus the number of games they lost is equal to the total number of games:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So they lost 7 games.  Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won:

7 + 8 = 15

The answer is 15. 
 Let's analyze the problem: There were 22 games played.  They won 8 more games than they lost.  This means that the number of games they won is 8 more than the number of games they lost. 

Let's say the number of games they lost is x.  Then, the number of games they won is x + 8. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So, the team lost 7 games.  The number of games they won is 7 + 8 = 15. 

The answer is 15. 
22 is the total number of games they played.  We know that the number of wins is 8 more than the number of losses.  Let's use a variable "L" for the number of losses.  Then the number of wins = L + 8.  We know the total is 22, so we can set up the equation L + (L + 8) = 22.  Combine L with L to get 2L + 8 = 22.  Subtract 8 from both sides to get 2L = 14.  Divide both sides by 2 to get L = 7.  So they lost 7 games.  To find the number of wins, we add 8 to 7, which is 15.  The answer is 15.

Subtract 8 from both sides to get 2L = 14.  Divide both sides by 2 to get L = 7.  So they lost 7 games.  To find the number of wins, we add 8 to 7, which is 15.  The answer is 15. ']
[EXP] 14: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 28, [output]:  Let's start with Cindy, who has 4 pets.  Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.  Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 6 x 3 = 18 pets.  To find the total number of pets, add the number of pets each has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.  The answer is 28. 
 Let's break it down step by step.  Cindy has 4 pets.  Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.  Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 6 x 3 = 18 pets.  In total, there are 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets.  The answer is 28. 
 Let's start by using the information that Cindy has 4 pets.  We know that Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. 

Since Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, Jan has 6 x 3 = 18 pets. 

To find the total number of pets the three have, we add up their individual numbers: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28 pets. 

The answer is 28. 
 Let's solve this problem step by step. 

1.  We know Cindy has 4 pets. 
2.  Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. 
3.  Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 6 * 3 = 18 pets. 
4.  To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 + 6 + 18 = 28. 

The answer is 28. 
 We know Cindy has 4 pets.  Marcia has 2 more than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.  Jan has 3 times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 6 x 3 = 18 pets.  Now, to find the total number of pets, we add them all together: 4 + 6 + 18 = 28.  The answer is 28. 
 Let's start by finding how many pets Marcia has.  Since Cindy has 4 pets, and Marcia has 2 more than Cindy, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. 

Next, since Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, we can multiply Marcia's number of pets by 3 to find Jan's number of pets: 6 x 3 = 18. 

Now we can add the number of pets that each of them has to find the total number of pets: 4 (Cindy's) + 6 (Marcia's) + 18 (Jan's) = 28. 

The answer is 28. 
 First, we find out how many pets Marcia has.  If Cindy has 4 pets and Marcia has two more, then Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.  Since Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, Jan has 3 x 6 = 18 pets.  To find the total number of pets, add the pets of the three: Cindy's 4 + Marcia's 6 + Jan's 18 = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28.

[EXP] 24: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]:  Anakin had 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish, so in total he had 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.  Locsin had 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which means Locsin had 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.  Locsin had 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which means Locsin had 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.  Locsin had 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which means Locsin had 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.  Locsin had 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.  In total, they have 19 + 13 = 32 fish.  The answer is 32. 
 Let's break it down:

Anakin: 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, 3 clownfish = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish

Locsin: 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin has 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin has 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin has 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Locsin has 5 starfish, 3 sea horses, 5 clownfish = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish

In total, they caught: Anakin's 19 + Locsin's 13 = 32 fish

The answer is 32. 
 First, let's find the number of fish that Anakin caught.  Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.  So, the total number of fish Anakin caught is:

10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish) = 19

Now, we need to find the number of fish Locsin caught.  Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught:

10 (starfish) - 5 = 5

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught:

6 (sea horses) - 3 = 3

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught:

3 (clownfish) + 2 = 5

Now, we can add the number of fish Anakin and Locsin caught:

19 (fish caught by Anakin) + 5 (starfish caught by Locsin) + 3 (sea horses caught by Locsin) + 5 (clownfish caught by Locsin) = 32

The answer is 32. 
 Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.  Locsin caught 5 less starfish, 3 less sea horses, and 2 more clownfish. 

To find the number of starfish caught by Locsin, subtract 5 from 10, which gives us 5.   Locsin found 5 starfish. 

To find the number of sea horses caught by Locsin, subtract 3 from 6, which gives us 3.  Locsin found 3 sea horses. 

To find the number of clownfish caught by Locsin, add 2 to 3, which gives us 5.  Locsin found 5 clownfish. 

In total, they caught:
10 starfish + 6 sea horses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish (from Anakin)
5 starfish + 3 sea horses + 5 clownfish = 13 fish (from Locsin)

Adding the number of fish caught by both, the total number of fish they caught is:

[EXP] 27: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 23, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 

Half of Jan's age two years ago is (30 - 2) / 2 = 28 / 2 = 14. 

Two years ago Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old. 

Mark is now 19 + 2 = 21 years old. 

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old. 

The answer is 23. 
 If Jan is 30, 2 years ago, Jan was 28.  Two years ago, Mark was half Jan's age, which is 14.  Then Mark was 5 years older, so two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19.  Now, Mark is 19 + 2 = 21 years old.  Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.  The answer is 23. 
 Let's break this down step by step. 

* "Two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age" means that Mark's age 2 years ago was 5 years more than half of Jan's age 2 years ago. 
* Since Mark's age 2 years ago was half of Jan's age 2 years ago plus 5, we can set up the equation: Mark's age 2 years ago = 1/2 * Jan's age 2 years ago + 5
* Jan is currently 30 years old, so her age 2 years ago was 30 - 2 = 28. 
* Plugging this into the equation above, we get: Mark's age 2 years ago = 1/2 * 28 + 5
* Simplifying the equation, we get: Mark's age 2 years ago = 14 + 5 = 19
* So Mark's age 2 years ago was 19.  This means that Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21. 
* Jean is 2 years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23. 

The answer is 23. 
 Let's work step by step!

Two years ago, Mark's age was X.  According to the problem, two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age, which is (30-2)/2 = 14 at that time.  So, we can set up an equation: X = 14 + 5, X = 19. 

This means Mark was 19 two years ago.  If Mark was 19 two years ago, he is currently 21 (19 + 2). 

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23.

 Carl started with 0 slices of cheese.  

For the 7 days (he had a sandwich each day), he used 7 sandwiches * 2 slices per sandwich = 14 slices of cheese. 

For the 3 days he had cheese and egg omelets, he used 3 omelets * (2 + 1) slices per omelet = 9 slices of cheese. 

He also used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

 Let’s break this problem down step by step. 

Carl used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, and he had a sandwich every day this week for lunch.  So, for the 7 days, he used 2 x 7 = 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches. 

For breakfast, he ate omelets 3 days for the week, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich.  So, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.  For 3 omelets, he used 3 x 3 = 9 slices of cheese.

 Let's first find the difference between the two aquariums: 32 - 4 = 28.  This is the difference.  Now, this difference is equal to twice the number of fish in both aquariums.  So, the number of fish in both aquariums must be 28 / 2 = 14.

[EXP] 38: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 168, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Andrea has 52 apples and she has 8 more apples than Jamal. 

So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples. 

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas. 

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. 

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas for both Andrea and Jamal:

For Andrea: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits
For Jamal: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits

In total, there are 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.  The answer is 168. 
 We are given that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal and half as many bananas as Jamal.  Let's declare the number of apples Jamal has as x.  Then, Andrea has x + 8 apples. 

We are also given that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has x bananas.  Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has x/2 bananas. 

We are also given that Andrea has 52 apples.  We can set up the equation:

x + 8 = 52

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives:

x = 44

Now we know Jamal has 44 apples.  Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas. 

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48/2 = 24 bananas. 

Finally, the total number of fruits is the sum of apples and bananas:

44 (Jamal's apples) + 52 (Andrea's apples) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) = 168

A packet of milk was sold at a discount of $0. 5.  4 packets of milk will cost 4 x 0. 5 = 2 dollars less than the original price.  So you will save 2 dollars on the milk. 
Adding both discounts, you will save 4 + 2 = 6 dollars.  The answer is 6. 
 Let's first find the savings on the ice cream.  The original price is $13 and the new price is $11.  The difference is $2, so you will save $2 per tub of ice cream.  If you buy 2 tubs, you will save 2 * 2 = 4 dollars on the ice cream. 

Then let's find the savings on the milk.  The original price is not given, but since it is discounted by $0. 5, the new price is $0. 5 less than the original.  If you buy 4 packets, you will save 4 * 0. 5 = 2 dollars on the milk. 

In total, you will save $4 on the ice cream and $2 on the milk.  So the total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.  The answer is 6.

 Tyson runs 5000 meters every day.  If his coach wants him to run 1/5 times more, that means 5000 * (1 + 1/5) = 5000 * 6/5 = 6000 meters.  Now, Tyson will run 6000 meters a day.  He trained for a month, which is 30 days.  So he ran a total of 6000 * 30 = 180000 meters.  The answer is 180000. 
 Tyson runs 5000 meters a day.  If he is told to run 1/5 times more, that means he has to run an additional 1000 meters.  So now he runs 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters a day.  If he runs for a month, which is 30 days, he runs 6000 x 30 = 180000 meters.  The answer is 180000.

[EXP] 52: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Morgan's dad said she has 90 dollars.  Mini-golf is 5 dollars per person.  Arcade tokens are 5 dollars.  And go-karts are 10 dollars a ride, but it's 2 rides, so that's 2 x 10 = 20 dollars.  So, in total, that's 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 dollars.  To find out how many friends she can invite, subtract 30 from 90.  90 - 30 is 60 dollars left.  Since mini-golf is 5 dollars per person, we can use that number to find out how many friends she can have.  60 ÷ 5 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
 Morgan had a budget of $90.  The mini-golf is $5 per person, arcade tokens are $5, and go-karts are $10 per ride.  The total cost for Morgan will be $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + 2 x $10 (go-karts) = $30.  So Morgan has $90 - $30 = $60 left for other expenses.  This must be equally divided among the friends.  So, 60 / ? = 5 each.  The answer is 12 friends. 
 Morgan's dad gave her 90 dollars budgeted for her birthday party.  She wants to spend money on mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts.  She wants to make sure everyone gets to play one round of mini-golf, so that's 5 dollars each.  She also wants 5 dollars each for her friends to use on arcade tokens.  And she wants to ride the go-karts twice, so that's 10 x 2 = 20 dollars. 

She already spent 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 dollars.  90 - 30 = 60 dollars left.  This means she has 60 dollars left to spend on food, cake, or other expenses.  She can invite her friends to the party, so to find out how many friends she can invite, we need to divide the leftover money by the money spent on each item: 60 / (5 = money for mini-golf + arcadeon tokens).  The 5 dollars include both expenses for mini-golf and arcade tokens, so we can divide 60 by 5. 

60 / 5 is 12.  The answer is 12. 
 Morgan's dad has 90 dollars for her birthday party.  Let's figure out how much money is needed for the rest of the activities.  
She wants to play one round of mini-golf, so that will be 5 dollars.  She wants 5 dollars in arcade tokens, and then she wants to ride the go-karts twice, which will be 10 + 10 = 20 dollars.  So in total, she needs 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 dollars for the non-friend activities. 
The total budget is 90 dollars, and the non-friend activities will take 30 dollars.  So the amount of money she can spend on her friends is 90 - 30 = 60 dollars.  She can think of the money spent on friends as spending a certain amount of money per friend.  This can be represented by a variable, say F.  The total money spent on friends will be F times the number of friends she invites.  So F * X = 60. 
The problem states that she wants to invite a certain number of friends, so we need to find the value of X.  By solving the equation F * X = 60, we can find the value of X. 
Let's think about the number of dollars spent on friends, F.  She can't spend a fraction of a dollar per friend, so F has to be a multiple of 5, since each friend can be bought a minimum of 5 dollars worth of stuff (one round of mini-golf, 1 dollar of arcade tokens, and one ride of the go-karts).

Let's say F is 5.  The price per friend will be 5 dollars.  After 12 friends (5 * 12 = 60), she will have no more money left for the birthday party.  So this is the maximum.

Since Marcy guarantees that only 1% will explode, we need to find 1% of the total candles, which is 1/100 * 50,000 = 500 candles. 

Since the problem asks us to find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the overlap between these two categories.  To do this, we'll look at the 2,500 candles that smell like wet dog.  1% of these candles will explode as well.  1% of 2,500 is 1/100 * 2,500 = 25. 

So, 25 of the candles made by Marcy will both smell like wet dog and explode.  The answer is 25. 
99% of the candles are not guaranteed to explode, which means 1% of the candles are guaranteed to explode.  That is 0. 01 x 50000 = 500 candles. 

Now, 5% of the candles also smell like wet dog.  Since only the defective candles have that problem, we need to find the number of defective candles.  0. 05 x 50000 = 2500 defective candles. 

Some of these candles explode.  Since only 5% of the candles defected, the 2500 defective candles are spread across two problems. 

So, the number of candles that smell like wet dog and explode will be the overlap between the 500 exploding candles and the 2500 defective candles. 

To find this overlap, we can multiply the number of exploding candles (500) by the defect rate (5%): 500 x 0. 05 = 25.

He will use this cash to buy the ticket to the amusement park, which costs $100, so he must have $100 - $50 = $50 remaining, which is from the cards he sold.  Since each card is $1. 5, the number of cards he sold is 50 / 1. 5 = 33. 33, which rounds up to 34 cards.  

Now, we know Kenny had 34 cards originally and kept 1/3 of his cards.  1/3 of ? = x, so x * 3 = 34.  x = 34/3 = 11. 33, which rounds down to 11.  This means he kept 11 cards and sold the rest.

Since each card is $1. 5, the number of cards he sold is 50 / 1. 5 = 33. 33, which rounds up to 34 cards.  \n\nNow, we know Kenny had 34 cards originally and kept 1/3 of his cards.  1/3 of ? = x, so x * 3 = 34.  x = 34/3 = 11. 33, which rounds down to 11.  This means he kept 11 cards and sold the rest.  \n\nTherefore, Kenny started with 34 + 11 = 45 cards.  The answer is 45. ']

[EXP] 76: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 12, [output]: 27 cups of raisins are in the bag.  For oatmeal cookies, 3/4 of a cup is needed per batch.  The number of batches that can be made is 27 divided by 3/4. 

First, we must convert 3/4 into a decimal.  3/4 = 0. 75. 

Now, we can divide 27 by 0. 75:

27 / 0. 75 = 36

The bag of raisins can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies. 

The answer is 36. 
27 cups of raisins are in the bag.  A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 cups of raisins.  Heather divides the raisins equally among the ingredients.  So, the number of batches of oatmeal cookies that can be made is calculated by dividing 27 cups of raisins by 3/4 cups of raisins per batch. 
27 / (3/4) = 36.  The answer is 36. 
27 cups of raisins are originally.  For each batch of oatmeal cookies, 3/4 cups of raisins are needed.  To find out how many batches she can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins (27) by the number of cups needed for each batch (3/4).  To do this, we convert the 3/4 to decimal: 3/4 = 0. 75.  Now we do the division: 27 / 0. 75.  This equals 36.  The answer is 36. 
27 cups of raisins in the bag.  Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 cups of raisins.  We want to know how many batches of cookies Heather can make. 

3/4 cups of raisins is the same as 0. 75 cups of raisins.  So for each batch of oatmeal cookies, Heather uses 0. 75 cups of raisins. 

If we divide the total cups of raisins in the bag, 27, by 0. 75, we get how many batches of cookies she can make. 

27 ÷ 0. 75 = 36

So Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies.  The answer is 36. 
27 cups of raisins in total.  For oatmeal cookies, the amount needed is 3/4 cup.  To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total raisins by the amount needed for one batch.  27 cups divided by 3/4 cups is 27 divided by 0. 75, which is 36. 

So, Heather can make 36/0. 75 = 36.

[EXP] 85: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 52, [output]:  Jared originally typed 47 words per minute.  After some lessons, he typed 52 words per minute.  Then, he increased to 52 + 5 = 57 words per minute. 

Now, we need to find the average of the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57. 

To do this, we add the three numbers and divide by 3:

(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52

The average of the three measurements is 52 words per minute. 

The answer is 52. 
 Jared's starting speed is 47 words per minute.  After increasing, his speed becomes 52 words per minute.  So the increase is 52 - 47 = 5 words.  Now, if his speed increases again by 5 words, he will be at 52 + 5 = 57 words per minute. 

To find the average, we need to add the three numbers and divide by 3. 

47 + 52 + 57 = 156

Divided by 3:

156 ÷ 3 = 52

The answer is 52. 
 To find the final typing speed, we add 5 words to 52 words per minute.  52 + 5 = 57 WPM.  So the three measurements are 47, 52, and 57 words per minute.  To find the average, we take the sum of these measurements and divide by the number of measurements.  47 + 52 + 57 = 156.  We then divide the sum by 3.  156 / 3 = 52.  The answer is 52. 
 Let's break it down. 

Jared starts with 47 WPM. 
Next, he tests at 52 WPM, which is an increase of 52 - 47 = 5. 
He continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 WPM. 
So, he will be at 52 + 5 = 57 WPM. 

To find the average of the three measurements, we add up all three and divide by 3:

(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52

So, the average of the three measurements is 52.  The answer is 52. 
1.  Jared initially has 47 words per minute.  2.  The next time he tests his typing speed, he increased by 5 words.  52 - 47 is 5, so that increase was 5 words.  He increased his typing speed by 5 words.  So the new measuring is 47 + 5 = 52.  2.  Next time he increases his speed, he will increase it by 5 words again.  So, 52 + 5 = 57.  So now he has 57 words per minute.  3.  Now we need to find the average of the three measurements.  To do this, add the three measurements together, then divide by 3.  47 + 52 + 57 is 156.  156 / 3 is 52.  The answer is 52.

[EXP] 86: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so let's say he was x years old 5 years ago.  Then, his current age would be x + 5. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: x + 5 = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 5 = 2x - 10

Add 10 to both sides:
x + 15 = 2x

Subtract x from both sides:
15 = x

So Jerry is 15 years old now. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

 Steve is 60 years old.  His wife is 4 years older, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.  His son is half as old as his mom, so the son's age is 64 / 2 = 32.  His son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.  The answer is 29. 
1) First, find out how old Steve's wife is: she is 4 years older than Steve, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old. 

2) Next, find out how old Steve's son is: he is half as old as his mom, so he is 64 / 2 = 32 years old. 

3) Finally, find out how old Steve's son's wife is: she is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old. 

The answer is 29.

3.  Their son is currently half as old as his mom, which is 64 / 2 = 32 years old. 
4.  Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, which means she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old. 

The answer is 29. 
 Let's start by using the information that the son is currently half as old as his mom.  The mom is 4 years older than Steve, so the mom's age is 60 + 4 = 64.  Since the son is half as old as his mom, his age is 64 / 2 = 32. 

Then, we are told that Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband.  So, her age is 32 - 3 = 29. 

The answer is 29. 
 Let's start by finding Steve's son's age.  Since his mom is 4 years older than Steve, his mom's age is 60 + 4 = 64.  Since Steve's son is half as old as his mom, his son's age is 64/2 = 32. 

Now, we know his wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so we subtract 3 from his age to get her age: 32 - 3 = 29.

[EXP] 94: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2100, [output]:  Ariadne earned $400 in a particular month from red hats.  Since green hat sales were twice as much as red hat sales, she earned 2 x 400 = 800 from green hats.  The total amount she earned in that month is 800 + 400 = 1200. 

In the second month, her total sales were 3/4 of the first month's sales, which is (3/4) * 1200 = 900.  Her sales from red hats in the second month were half of that, which is 900/2 = 450.  Her sales from green hats were 900 - 450 = 450. 

The total amount she made in two months is 1200 (first month) + 900 = 2100.  The answer is 2100. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 

In a particular month, Aria had sales from red hats of $400.  Since this was half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, the total amount from selling green hats is:

$400 x 2 = $800

The total amount earned in the first month = $800 (green hats) + $400 (red hats) = $1200

In the second month, her sales are 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.  To find the total sales in the second month, multiply the total sales in the first month by 3/4:

$1200 x 3/4 = $900

Since the second month's sales are $900, the total amount earned in two months is the sum of the sales in each month:

$1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100

The answer is 2100.

[EXP] 95: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  It takes Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.  It took her 20 minutes more to cook pork, so it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.  The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so it took her (30 + 50) / 2 = 40 minutes to cook beans.  In total, it took her 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes to cook all the food.  The answer is 120. 
 Let's start by using the information that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.  If it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, then it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork. 

We are also given that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.  Combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes.  Half of 80 is 40 minutes.  So it took Finley 40 minutes to cook beans. 

Let's calculate the total time it took to cook all the food: rice + pork + beans = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes. 

The answer is 120. 
 Let's break down the information given:

* It took 30 minutes to cook rice. 
* It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so it took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork. 
* Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.  The combined cooking time is 50 + 30 = 80 minutes.  Half of 80 is 40 minutes. 

Since the cooking times for pork and beans are 50 and 40 minutes, the total time it took to cook all the food is:
30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes

The answer is 120. 
 Finley had to cook rice for 30 minutes.  Pork took 20 minutes more than that, so 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.  Combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes.  Beans took half this time, which is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.  To cook all foods, she took 30 minutes for rice, 50 minutes for pork, and 40 minutes for beans.  30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.  The answer is 120. 
 Let's start by using the information that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice.  We can use this to find the cooking time for the pork. 

If it took Finley 20 more minutes to cook the pork than rice, then the cooking time for the pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes. 

Next, we are told that the beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.  Since it took 30 minutes to cook the rice, and 50 minutes to cook the pork, the combined cooking time is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes.  Half of 80 is 40 minutes. 

So, it took Finley 40 minutes to cook the beans. 

To find the total cooking time, we can add the cooking times for all the food:

In total, there are 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.  Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area is 68 x 1 x 1 = 68 square feet.  The answer is 68. 
 From the problem, Brittany's comforter has 14 red squares, and 4 more blue squares than red squares.  So the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.  6 more green squares than blue squares, so the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.  12 fewer white squares than green squares, so the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.  In total, there are 14 red squares + 18 blue squares + 24 green squares + 12 white squares = 68 squares.  Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the area of one square is 1 square foot.  The total area of the comforter is 68 * 1 = 68 square feet.  The answer is 68. 
 Let's start by figuring out how many blue squares Brittany's comforter has.  Since it has 4 more blue squares than red, and it has 14 red squares, it has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.  

Since it has 6 more green squares than blue squares, it has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.  

Finally, since it has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, it has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares. 

In total, it has 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.  

Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so it's area is 1 foot squared.  

To find the total area of the comforter, we multiply the number of squares by the area of each square: 
68 squares * 1 square foot per square = 68 square feet.  
The answer is 68.

[EXP] 107: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]: 80 students are in both classes.  2 classes have the same amount of students, so 80 divided by 2 is 40 students in each class.  40% of the students in each class are girls, so 40% of 40 is 16 girls in each class.  40 - 16 is 24 boys in each class.  The answer is 24. 
80 students are in total in the two classes.  Each class has the same number of students, so let's call that x.  2x = 80, so x = 40.  So each class has 40 students. 

In each class, 40% of the students are girls.  40% of 40 is 16.  So 16 girls are in each class. 

That means 40 - 16 = 24 students are boys in each class.  The answer is 24. 
 Since there are 2 classes with the same amount of students, the number of students in each class is half of the total number of students.  
So, the number of students in each class is 80 / 2 = 40.

54 students are to be separated into 6 groups.  So, each group will have 54 ÷ 6 = 9 students.  But the activity requires 12 groups.  Since there are 6 groups now, 12 - 6 = 6 more groups are needed.  The answer is 6. 
54 students need to be separated into 6 groups of equal size.  So the size of each group is 54 / 6 = 9.

[EXP] 109: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]:  Let's assume the number of votes against the new regulation is x.  Since there are twice as many votes in favor as there are against, the number of votes in favor is 2x.  The total number of votes, which is the sum of the votes in favor and against, is 33. 

We can set up the equation:
x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:
3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 11

So, there were 11 votes against the new regulation.  Since there are twice as many votes in favor as there are against, the number of votes in favor is:
2x = 2(11) = 22

The answer is 22. 
33 people are on the council.  The number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against.  Let x be the number of votes against the new regulation.  Then the number of votes in favor is 2x.  We know that the sum of the votes in favor and against is 33, so:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

So there were 11 votes against the new regulation.  Since the votes in favor are twice this number, there were:

2x = 2(11) = 22

votes in favor of the new regulation.  The answer is 22. 
33 people are on the council.  The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number against.  Let's call the number of votes against the new regulation x.  Then the number of votes in favor is 2x.  The total number of people is 33, so:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

The number of votes against the new regulation is 11.  The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice that, which is 2x = 2(11) = 22.  The answer is 22. 
33 people on the council, and the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the rule as against it.  Let's say there are a votes against, then the votes in favor would be 2a.  Therefore, we can set up the equation:
a + 2a = 33

Combine like terms:
3a = 33

Divide by 3:
a = 11

So there were 11 votes against the rule.  Since the votes in favor were twice as many, there were 2 * 11 = 22 votes in favor.  The answer is 22. 
33 people are on the council.  There were as many votes in favor as 2 times as many against.  Let's first say the number of votes against is x.  Then the number of votes in favor is 2x.  The total number of votes is the sum of the votes against and the votes for, which is x + 2x = 3x.  Since the total number of council members is 33, we can set up the equation 3x = 33.  To solve this equation, we divide both sides by 3, which gives x = 11.  So there were 11 votes against the regulation.  Now we can find the number of votes for by using 2x, which is 2 * 11 = 22.

[EXP] 113: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 1.  Calculate how many miles Andy drives per week: Andy drives 5 miles to and from work each day, 5 days a week.  So the total distance is 5 * 2 * 5 = 50 miles. 

2.  Calculate how much fuel is consumed per week: To calculate the total fuel used, we can divide the miles by the MPG: 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons. 

3.  Calculate the cost of the fuel per week: Now that we know how much fuel is used, we can calculate the total cost of the fuel: 5 gallons x 3 dollars/gallon = 15 dollars. 

The answer is 15 dollars. 
 Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon.  The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles.  So it will take 5 / 10 = 0. 5 gallons to travel to work and back.  

Every week, Andy drives to work and back, 5 days a week.  So he drives 10 * 5 = 50 miles a week.  The amount of gasoline Andy's car uses in a week is 50 / 10 = 5 gallons.  

Each gallon of gas costs $3.  So, the total cost of gas is 5 gallons * $3 gallon = $15.  The answer is 15.

[EXP] 115: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Billy was originally paid 10 dollars per hour.  For 2 months, he was paid 10 * 20 = 200 dollars.  After a raise of 0. 5 dollars per hour, he was paid 10. 5 dollars per hour.  So for 2 months, he earned 10. 5 * 20 = 210 dollars.  After another raise of 1 dollar, he earned 11. 5 dollars per hour.  So he earned 11. 5 * 20 = 230 dollars in total.  Sally earns 0. 5 dollars more than Billy's original salary, so she starts earning 10. 5 dollars per hour.  So she earns 10. 5 * 20 dollars = 210 dollars.  Billy earns 230 - 210 = 20 dollars more than Sally.  The answer is 20. 
 Let's first find Billy's salary after the raises.  Billy's initial salary is 10 dollars per hour.  After the first raise, Billy makes 10 + 0. 5 = 10. 50 per hour.  After the second raise, Billy makes 10. 50 + 1. 0 = 11. 50 per hour.  Billy works 20 hours, so he earns 11. 50 * 20 = 230.  

Now let's find Sally's salary.  Sally's salary is 0. 50 dollars more than Billy's initial salary, which is 10 dollars.  So Sally makes 10 + 0. 5 = 10. 50 dollars per hour.  Sally also works 20 hours, so she earns 10. 50 * 20 = 210 dollars. 

To find how much more Billy earns than Sally, subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: 230 - 210 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
 Billy initially earns 10 dollars per hour.  After 2 months, he earned an hourly rate of 10 + 0. 5 = 10. 5 dollars.  And after 1 year, he earns 10. 5 + 1 = 11. 5 dollars.  If Billy works 20 hours, his salary will be 20 * 11. 5 dollars.  This is 230 dollars. 

Sally earns 0. 5 dollars more than Billy's starting salary.  Her salary is 0. 5 + 10 = 10. 5 dollars.  20 * 10. 5 is 210 dollars. 

So Billy makes 230 - 210 dollars more than Sally.  230 - 210 is 20.  The answer is 20. 
 Billy's initial payment per hour is 10 dollars.  He was given a raise of 0. 50 dollars per hour, so his new payment after 2 months is 10 + 0. 50 = 10. 50.  Then, on his first anniversary at work he was given another raise of 1. 00 dollars per hour.  His final payment per hour is 10. 50 + 1. 00 = 11. 50. 

Sally started working at a different business at a starting salary that is 0. 50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary.  Billy's starting salary is 10 dollars per hour, so Sally's starting salary is 10 + 0. 50 = 10. 50.  Then she also works for 20 hours.  If Billy earns 11. 50 dollars per hour, and Sally earns 10. 50 dollars per hour, after 20 hours Billy would earn 11. 50 * 20 = 230 dollars and Sally would earn 10. 50 * 20 = 210 dollars.

[EXP] 120: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Let's start by finding how high Saskay can lift a mountain:

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher, which is 12 inches or 1 foot. 

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 x 1 foot = 4 feet. 

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 x 4 feet = 40 feet. 

The answer is 40. 
 If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches (12 times higher).  Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so he can lift a mountain 4 x 12 = 48 inches.  Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so he can lift a mountain 10 x 48 = 480 inches.  Since there are 12 inches in 1 foot, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high.  The answer is 40. 
 Since Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher, which is 1 x 12 = 12 inches.

The next year, she will get 0. 75 * 918. 75 = 688. 8125.  She now has 918. 75 + 688. 8125 = 1607. 5625.  The answer is 1607. 5625. 
 Brenda started with $300.  The interest rate is 3/4, or 0. 75, and it's expressed as a fraction of the original amount.  

The first year, the interest will be 0. 75 x 300 = 225.  So at the end of the first year, Brenda will have 300 + 225 = 525. 

The second year, the interest will be 0. 75 x 525 = 393. 75, but Brenda already has 525.  So she will have 525 + 393. 75 = 918. 75 at the end of the second year.

Year 3: They will count the total number of homes built so far (12 + 36 = 48) and double it, which becomes 48 x 2 = 96 homes. 

To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we add the number of homes built in each year:

12 (Year 1) + 36 (Year 2) + 96 (Year 3) = 144 homes

The answer is 144. 
 The town will build 12 homes in the first year.  In the next year, they will build three times this many homes.  12 * 3 = 36.  So in the second year, they will build 36 homes.  In the third year, they will double the amount of homes they've built so far (12 + 36 = 48 and then double it).  48 * 2 = 96.

Now, let's count the total number of homes built over the three years: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.  The answer is 144. 
 The town starts building 12 homes in the first year.  
In the second year, they build three times this many homes, which is 3 x 12 = 36. 
In the third year, they double the total number of homes they have built, so they double the total number of homes built so far (12 + 36 = 48).  48 doubled is 96. 
Total number of homes built is 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.  The answer is 144. 
 Let's start by building the new homes in the first year.  The town will build 12 homes.  Then, in the next year, they will build three times this many homes.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, subtract 36 - 6 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
 Claire earns 12 badges in a year (1 badge a month).  Amber earns half the badges that Claire does, so 6 badges in a year.  Wendy earns three times the badges that Claire does, so 36 badges in a year.  Wendy earns 36 - 6 = 30 more badges than Amber in a year.  The answer is 30. 
 Claire earns 1 badge each month, so in a year she earns 12 badges.  Amber earns half of Claire's badges, so Amber earns 12/2 = 6 badges a year.  Wendy earns three times as many badges as Claire, so she earns 12 x 3 = 36 badges a year.  So Wendy earns 36 - 6 = 30 more badges than Amber.  The answer is 30. 
 In one year, Claire earns 12 badges.  It takes Amber 2 times as long to earn a badge, so Amber earns 12/2 = 6 badges.  Wendy earns 3 times the amount of badges as Claire, so Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges.  We can find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber by subtracting the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns.  36 - 6 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
 Claire earns 1 badge every month, so in 12 months she will earn 12 badges.  Amber earns badges at half the rate of Claire, so Amber will earn 12 / 2 = 6 badges in 12 months.  Wendy earns badges at 3 times the rate of Claire, so Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in 12 months.  The difference between Amber's badges and Wendy's badges is 36 - 6 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
 Since Claire earns 1 badge per month, she earns 1 x 12 = 12 badges in a year.   Amber earns 1/2 of what Claire does, so she earns 12/2 = 6 badges in 1 year.   Wendy earns 3 times what Claire does, so she earns 3 x 12 = 36 badges in 1 year.

First, let's find out how many acres Farmer Smith's farm has.  If Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice Farmer Brown's farm, and Farmer Brown's farm has 200 acres, then we can write an equation:

Farmer Smith's farm = 2 x Farmer Brown's farm + 100
Farmer Smith's farm = 2 x 200 + 100
Farmer Smith's farm = 400 + 100
Farmer Smith's farm = 500

So, Farmer Smith's farm has 500 acres. 

Now, let's find the total number of acres the two farms have together.  We can add the number of acres for each farm:

Total acres = Farmer Brown's farm + Farmer Smith's farm
Total acres = 200 + 500
Total acres = 700

The answer is 700 acres. 
200 is the number of acres in Farmer Brown's farm.  Farmer Smith's farm has twice that amount plus 100.  So it is 2 x 200 + 100 acres in size.  2 x 200 is 400, and 400 + 100 is 500.  In total, the two farms have 200 + 500 = 700 acres.  The answer is 700.

[EXP] 133: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step.  The sloth makes a trip down the tree, picks berries, and climbs back up every 4 hours.  To collect 24 berries in 8 hours, he will make 8/4 = 2 trips.  He'll pick the same number of berries on each trip, so we divide 24 by 2 to get 12 berries per trip.  The answer is 12. 
 The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.  In 1 hour, he can collect berries for 8/4 = 2 trips.  In total, he will make 8/4 = 2 sets of 4 hour trips.  So, in each trip, he will collect 24 / 2 = 12 berries.  The answer is 12. 
24 berries in 8 hours is 24 berries in 2 trips.  The sloth spends 8 hours eating berries, so he spends exactly 4 hours for each trip.  The least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to make 2 trips in 4 hours is 12.  The answer is 12. 
 The sloth only eats when he's in his tree.  It takes him 4 hours to make the trip, pick up berries, and climb back up each time.  Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, he can only make 8/4 = 2 trips down to the ground.  He can pick up the same number of berries on each of those trips, so the question is asking what is the smallest number of berries he can pick up per trip to get a total of 24 berries.   We know 2 trips * x berries per trip = 24, so 2x = 24.  To find x, we divide both sides by 2 to get x = 12.  The answer is 12.

[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let Paul's age be P and John's age be J. 
We know that Paul is 10 years older than John, so P = J + 10. 
We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age is P + J. 
The combined age of Peter, Paul and John is 100 years old, so we can set up the equation:
P + J + P = 100
Or, using the expression we found for P:
J + J + 10 + J = 100
Combine like terms:
3J + 10 = 100
Subtract 10 from both sides:
3J = 90
Divide by 3:
J = 30
So John is 30 years old.  Paul is 10 years older than John, so Paul is 30 + 10 = 40 years old.  We can find Peter's age by adding John's age and Paul's age:
Peter's age = P + J
= 40 + 30
= 70
The answer is 70. 
 We are given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old.  We are also given that Paul is 10 years older than Jean.  Let's call Jean's age "J".  Then, Paul's age is J + 10.  

Furthermore, we are told that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.  In other words, Peter's age is J + 10 + J, which is 2J + 10. 

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100, so we can set up the equation 2J + 10 + J = 100.  This simplifies to 3J + 10 = 100. 

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us 3J = 90.  Dividing both sides by 3 gives us J = 30. 

So Jean's age is 30.  Paul is 10 years older, so his age is 30 + 10 = 40.  Peter's age is J + 10 + J, which is 2J + 10 = 60 + 10 = 70.

[EXP] 135: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  John earned $50 per hour, and worked 6 hours, so he earned 50 * 6 = $300.  After spending $50 on gas, he has $250 left.  He wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so he has $250 - $100 = $150 left.  5 pencils for $10 each will cost 5 * 10 = $50.  So he has $150 - $50 = $100 left.  If each pen costs $25, he can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens. 
 First, let's calculate how much money John earned.  He earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned 50 x 6 = 300 dollars.  After spending 50 dollars on gas, he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars.  He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left.  He can buy pens for 25 dollars each or pencils for 10 dollars each.  Let's calculate how many 25-dollar pens he can buy.  150 divided by 25 is 6, so he can buy 6 pens. 
 John earned 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.  After spending 50 dollars on gas, he had 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.  He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left.  He can buy 150 / 25 = 6 pens.  Since he also buys 5 pencils for 10 dollars each, he will spend 5 x 10 = 50 dollars on pencils.  So, he has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left, and he can buy 100 / 25 = 4 more pens.  In total, he can buy 6 + 4 = 10 pens after buying 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each. 
1) John earns 50 dollars per hour and worked 6 hours, so he earns 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.  2) He spends $50 on gas, leaving him with 300 - 50 = 250 dollars.  3) He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, leaving him with 250 - 100 = 150 dollars.  4) There is no information given about the 25 dollar pens and the 10 dollar pencils, so there is no way to determine how many pens he can buy. 
 Let's first calculate John's total earnings for the week:

John earns $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so:

$50/hour * 6 hours = $300

John spent $50 on gas, so he has:

$300 - $50 = $250

He wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so he is left with:

$250 - $100 = $150

John has $150 left to spend.  Pencils cost $10 each, and he wants to buy 5 pencils, so:

$10/pencil * 5 pencils = $50

John spends $50 on pencils, leaving him with:

$150 - $50 = $100

He has $100 left and wants to buy pens that cost $25 each.  How many pens can he buy?

100 / 25 = 4

John can buy 4 pens. 
 First, calculate John's total income:
John earns $50 per hour and works 6 hours, so his income is $50 * 6 = $300. 

Next, find out how much he spends:
He spends $50 on gas, leaving him with $300 - $50 = $250. 

He wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so he will have $250 - $100 = $150 left. 

Each pen costs $25, and he can buy pens with the remaining $150.  To find out how many pens he can buy, divide $150 by $25:
$150 ÷ $25 = 6

So John can buy 6 pens. 
 Firstly, let's calculate how much John earned.  50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours means John earned 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.  He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.  He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so that means he has 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left.  He wants to buy pens that cost 25 dollars each and 5 pencils for 10 dollars each.  The total amount of money for pens and pencils is 5 * 10 = 50 plus the number of pens he can buy, which is x * 25 dollars.  The total should be equal to the remaining money he has.  

The equation will be 50 + 25x = 150.  To find x, solve for x.  Subtract 50 from both sides.  25x = 100, so divide both sides by 25.  x = 100 / 25 = 4. 
 Voted result:  John earned $50 per hour, and worked 6 hours, so he earned 50 * 6 = $300.  After spending $50 on gas, he has $250 left.

[EXP] 136: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step!

1.  James has to swim 20 miles.  He swims 60% of the distance, so he swims 0. 6 x 20 = 12 miles. 
2.  Since it takes him 1 hour to swim 2 miles, it takes him 12 / 2 = 6 hours to swim 12 miles. 
3.  After resting for half as long as the swimming time, he rests for 6 / 2 = 3 hours. 
4.  Now, he has to swim the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.  He swims at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour. 
5.  To swim 8 miles at a pace of 1 mile per hour, it will take him 8 hours. 
6.  In total, James took 6 hours to swim 12 miles, 3 hours to rest, and 8 hours to swim the remaining distance.  This adds up to 17 hours. 

The answer is 17 hours. 
 James started by swimming 60% of the distance across the lake.  60% of 20 is 0. 60x20=12.  So he swims 12 miles.  This takes him 12 / 2 = 6 hours.  After that, he rests for half as long, or 3 hours.  He still has 20-12=8 miles left.  But he swims this part at half his original speed, or 1 mile per hour.  So it takes him 8 hours to swim the remaining distance.  In total, it takes him 6+3+8=17 hours.  The answer is 17. 
 James has to swim 20 miles.  He can swim 2 miles per hour.  So he can swim it in 20 / 2 = 10 hours.  
James only swam 60% of the distance, so he swam 60% * 20 = 0. 6 * 20 = 12 miles.  This took him 12 / 2 = 6 hours.  
If he rested for half the time as the swimming time, that means he rested for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.  
After resting, he still has to swim the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.  He swims at half his speed, which is 1 mile per hour.  It took him 8 / 1 = 8 hours to finish the remaining distance.  
In total, it took him 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours to make it across the lake.  The answer is 17. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Initially, James starts with a 20-mile lake and has to swim the whole distance.  He swims 60% of the distance, which is:
20 x 0. 60 = 12 miles

The time it takes James to swim 12 miles is:
12 miles / 2 miles/hour = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, he rests for half as long as the swimming time:
6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

James then continues swimming the remaining distance:
20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

At half the speed, James's new swimming speed is:
2 miles/hour / 2 = 1 mile/hour

The time it takes James to swim the remaining 8 miles is:
8 miles / 1 mile/hour = 8 hours

Adding the swimming time, rest time, and the second swimming time, James's total time to cross the lake is:
6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

The answer is 17 hours.

1.  Greta started with 1 "dozen" (12) brownies that she made herself. 
2.  At her office, they sent her home with 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies, so in total, she had 12 + 6 = 18 brownies. 
3.  At her surprise party, she got 4 dozen (48) brownies, so now she has 18 + 48 = 66 brownies. 
4.  During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.  So, we subtract 18 from 66: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left. 

The answer is 48. 
 Starting with the brownies that Greta made for herself, there was 1 dozen = 12 brownies.  At her office, she received 1/2 a dozen = 6 brownies.  At her home, her friends gave her 4 dozen = 48 brownies.  Total brownies at this point = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.  But during the party, 1 1/2 dozen = 18 brownies were eaten.  So, she had 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left.  The answer is 48.

Total time needed is 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

[EXP] 147: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that each small stuffed animal costs $4.  We know that Teresa earned $120 from the sales, and she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.  Let's assume she sold x large stuffed animals.  Then she sold 2x small stuffed animals. 

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 4 * 3 = $12. 

The total amount Teresa earned from the sales is the sum of the earnings from the small and large stuffed animals: 4 * 2x + 12x = 120. 

Combine like terms: 8x + 12x = 120

Combine terms: 20x = 120

Divide by 20: x = 6

Since x is the number of large stuffed animals, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals.  Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals, she sold 2x = 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals. 

The answer is 12. 
 Let’s break this problem down step by step.  Firstly, Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals.  This means that if the small stuffed animals cost $4 each, the large ones will cost $4 x 3 = $12 each. 

Secondly, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.  This means that if she sold x large stuffed animals, she sold 2x small stuffed animals. 

Thirdly, Teresa earned a total of $120 from the sales.  We can set up an equation to represent this:

Small stuffed animals x 4 + Large stuffed animals x 12 = 120

Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, we can substitute 2x for x:

4(2x) + 12x = 120

Combine like terms:

8x + 12x = 120

Combine 8x and 12x:

20x = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 6

So Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals and 2x = 12 small stuffed animals.  The answer is 12. 
3 times the price of small loaded animals means the big ones cost 4 * 3 = 12 dollars.  Twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones means the number of small stuffed animals is 2x.  The number of large stuffed animals is x.  So, she sold x large stuffed animals and 2x small stuffed animals.  She earned 120 dollars.  So, x times 12 + 2x times 4 is 120.  Let's solve for x.  12x + 8x = 120.  20x = 120.  x = 6.  Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals.  Since there are twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x = 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.  The answer is 12.

So the time it takes to go down is 300 / 60 = 5 minutes.  The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long and people slide down it at 80 feet per minute.  So the time it takes to go down is 240 / 80 = 3 minutes.  The difference between the two times is 5 - 3 = 2 minutes.  The answer is 2. 
1st lets find the time it takes to slide down the biggest waterslide.  (300 ft) / (60 ft/min) = 5 minutes.  Now, lets find the time it takes to slide down the second biggest waterslide.  (240 ft) / (80 ft/min) = 3 minutes.  The difference is 5 - 3 = 2 minutes.  The answer is 2. 
 The problem is asking how much longer it takes to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest slide.  

The biggest waterslide is 300 feet long and people slide down at 60 feet per minute.  To find out how many minutes it takes to ride the biggest slide, we divide the length of the slide by the speed: 300 / 60 = 5 minutes. 

The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long and people slide down at 80 feet per minute.  To find out how many minutes it takes to ride the second biggest slide, we divide the length of the slide by the speed: 240 / 80 = 3 minutes. 

The difference between the two times is 5 minutes (biggest slide) - 3 minutes (second biggest slide) = 2 minutes.  

The answer is 2. 
 The big slide is 300 feet long, with people going down at 60 feet/minute.  So it will take 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes.  

The smaller slide is 240 feet long, with people going down at 80 feet/minute.  So it will take 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.  

Since it takes 5 minutes for the big slide and 3 minutes for the small slide, the difference is 5 - 3 = 2 minutes.  The answer is 2. 
 It's not as simple as subtracting the lengths of the slides because speed also plays a role.  More speed means less time to ride the slide.  Let's calculate how long it takes to ride each slide. 

For the first slide, it's 300 feet long and the speed is 60 feet per minute.  So the time taken to ride it would be:

Time = Distance / Speed = 300 / 60 = 5 minutes

For the second slide, it's 240 feet long and the speed is 80 feet per minute.  So the time taken to ride it would be:

Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 minutes

To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide, we subtract the time taken to ride the second biggest slide:

Time difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

[EXP] 160: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: -3, [output]:  The temperature was originally 2 degrees Celsius.  It dropped 8 degrees, so now it is 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius.  Then it increased 3 degrees, so now it is -6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius.  The answer is -3. 
2 - 8 = -6 degrees.  Then it increased 3 degrees.  -6 + 3 = -3.  The answer is -3. 
 Let's work it out step by step!

The temperature was initially 2 degrees Celsius. 

It dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight, so the temperature became 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius. 

Then, it increased 3 degrees Celsius in the morning, so the temperature became -6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius. 

The answer is -3. 
 Starting with 2 degrees, the temperature dropped 8 degrees overnight, so it became 2 - 8 = -6 degrees.  Then it increased 3 degrees in the morning, so it became -6 + 3 = -3 degrees.  The answer is -3. 
2 degrees Celsius initially.  After dropping 8 degrees Celsius overnight, it becomes 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius.  Then it increased 3 degrees Celsius in the morning, so it becomes -6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius.  The answer is -3. 
 The temperature was originally 2 degrees Celsius.  It then dropped 8 degrees, so it would be 2 - 8 = -6 degrees.  After increasing 3 degrees, the temperature would be -6 + 3 = -3 degrees.  The answer is -3. 
2 - 8 = 2 - 8 = -6. 
Then it increased by 3 degrees.  -6 + 3 = -6 + 3 = -3. 

The answer is -3. 
2 is the original temperature. minus 8, it would be 2 - 8 = -6 Celsius.  Adding 3 to that, it would be -6 + 3 = -3.  The answer is -3.

[EXP] 162: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 750, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step:

1.  The average car can go 120 miles per hour. 
2.  The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so it goes 5 x 120 = 600 miles per hour. 
3.  The fastest car is 1. 25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so it goes 1. 25 x 600 = 750 miles per hour. 

The answer is 750. 
120 is the speed of the average car.  The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster, which is 5 x 120 = 600.  The fastest car is 1. 25 times faster, which is 1. 25 x 600 = 750.  The answer is 750.

3.  The fastest car is 1. 25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so it goes 600 x 1. 25 = 750 mph. 

The answer is 750 mph. 
 Let's figure it out step by step.  

The average car goes 120 miles per hour.  The 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster, so it goes 5 x 120 = 600 miles per hour. 

The fastest car is 1. 25 times faster than the 2nd fastest, so it goes 1. 25 x 600 = 750 miles per hour.  The answer is 750. 
 Rani found that the fastest car was 1. 25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.  It also found out that the 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car.  Since the average car can go 120 miles per hour, the 2nd fastest car can go 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.  The fastest car can then go 1. 25 times that, which is 600 * 1. 25 = 750 miles per hour.  The answer is 750. 
 This problem can be solved using ratios. 

The average car can go 120 mph.  The 2nd fastest car can go 5 times as fast as the average car, so it goes 120 * 5 = 600 mph.

If Rissa was given thrice as much money as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given 5 dollars, then Rissa was given 3 x 5 = 15 dollars. 

Then, Rissa lends an equal amount to her little sister.  So they both lend the same amount.  Let's call that amount x. 

Rissa's new amount of money is her initial amount minus the amount she lent.  So, 15 - x. 

We are told that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her initial amount.  So, we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5)15

15 - x = 12

x = 3

So, Rissa lent 3 dollars to her little sister.  Since they both lent the same amount, Ronnie also lent 3 dollars. 

Ronnie started with 5 dollars.  He lent 3 dollars, so he has 5 - 3 = 2 dollars left.  The answer is 2.

[EXP] 172: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2400, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600.  So the cost of each bottle of scotch is 600 / 10 = 60 dollars. 

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac (2 x 10 = 20) that cost 50% more per bottle.  50% more than 60 is 90, so each bottle of cognac costs 90 dollars. 

John spends 10 * 60 = 600 dollars on scotch and 20 * 90 = 1800 dollars on cognac.  Total cost is 600 + 1800 = 2400 dollars. 

The answer is 2400. 
10 scotch bottles for $600 means that one bottle of scotch costs $600 / 10 = $60.  Twice as many cognac bottles means 20 bottles.  Cognac is 50% more than scotch, or 1. 5 times the price.  So one bottle of cognac costs $60 * 1. 5 = $90.  The total cost for cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.  In total, John spends $1800 + $600 = $2400.  The answer is 2400. 
10 bottles of scotch for $600 cost $600/10 = $60 per bottle.  2 times as many bottles of cognac would be 10 * 2 = 20 bottles.  The bottles cost 50% more, so each costs $60 * 1. 5 = $90 per bottle.  The cost of the 20 bottles is 20 * 90 = 1800.  In total, John spends 600 + 1800 = 2400.  The answer is 2400. 
 First, we need to find the cost of the cognac.  John bought 10 bottles of scotch, and the total cost is 600.  So, the cost per bottle of scotch is 600 ÷ 10 = 60.  The number of bottles of cognac is twice that, or 10 x 2 = 20.  Since cognac costs 50% more than scotch, each cognac bottle costs 60 x 1. 5 = 90.  The total cost of the cognac is 20 x 90 = 1800.  The total cost of everything is the sum of the cost of scotch and the cost of cognac: 600 + 1800 = 2400.  The answer is 2400. 
 The first step is to figure out the cost per bottle of scotch.  Since John spent 600 dollars for 10 bottles, the cost per bottle is 600 / 10 = 60 dollars.  Now, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac.  10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.  These bottles cost 50% more than the scotch, so 50% more than 60 dollars, which is 1. 5 * 60 = 90 dollars per bottle of cognac.  Now, the total cost of cognac is 20 * 90 = 1800 dollars.  The total amount spent on both scotch and cognac is 600 + 1800 = 2400.  The answer is 2400. 
 To start, we need to know how many bottles of cognac John bought.  Since he bought twice as many bottles of cognac than scotch (10 bottles of scotch), he bought 2 x 10 = 20 bottles of cognac. 

The cost of 1 bottle of scotch is 600 / 10 = 60 dollars. 

The cost of cognac is 50% more than the bottle of scotch, so it is 1. 5 * 60 = 90 dollars per bottle. 

John bought 20 bottles of cognac, so the cost of cognac is 20 * 90 = 1800 dollars. 

John also bought 10 bottles of scotch, so the cost of scotch is 10 * 60 = 600 dollars. 

The total cost is 1800 + 600 = 2400 dollars.

[EXP] 176: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  First, let's figure out how many treats Carly made in total.  There are five people in the class, and each person gets two treats, so the total number of treats is 5 x 2 = 10. 

Next, we know that the number of brownies is 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes.  Let's say the number of cupcakes is x.  Then, the number of brownies is 3x - 2. 

We know that the total number of treats is equal to the number of cupcakes plus the number of brownies, so we can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

So Carly made 3 cupcakes.  The answer is 3. 
 Let's start by using the information that each person gets two treats.  Since there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 x 5 = 10. 

Since Carly makes cupcakes and brownies, the total number of treats she makes is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies.  This sum is equal to 10, since each person gets 2 treats. 

Let's say the number of cupcakes Carly makes is x.  Then, the number of brownies she makes is 3x - 2, since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.  The total number of treats is therefore x + (3x - 2) = 10. 

Combining like terms, we get 4x - 2 = 10.  Adding 2 to both sides gives 4x = 12.  Dividing both sides by 4 gives x = 3.  Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes. 

The answer is 3. 
 Let's solve the problem step by step.  Let's use the variable C for the number of cupcakes.  We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.  Brownies = 3C - 2.  Each person in the class gets 2 treats, so the total treats is 2 x 5 = 10.  The total number of treats is equal to the number of cupcakes plus the number of brownies, so we have an equation: C + (3C - 2) = 10.  We can simplify the equation to: 4C - 2 = 10.  Add 2 to both sides to get: 4C = 12.  Divide both sides by 4 to get: C = 3.  The answer is 3.

 Let's break it down step by step. 

First, Mark gets the radiator at 80% off.  To find the discounted price, you multiply the original price by 0. 2 to find the discount (0. 2 x 400 = 80), then subtract the discount from the original price (400 - 80 = 320). 

Next, Mark hires a mechanic for 3 hours at $50 an hour.  To find the total cost of labor, you multiply the number of hours by the hourly rate (3 x 50 = 150). 

To find the total cost, add the cost of the radiator to the cost of labor (320 + 150 = 470). 

The answer is 470. 
 The cost of the radiator at the junk shop is 400 dollars.  But Mark gets 80% off, so that's 400 x 0. 20 = 80 dollars discount.  So Mark paid 400 - 80 = 320 dollars for the radiator.  Then he paid his mechanic 50 dollars for each of 3 hours, which is 50 x 3 = 150 dollars.  In total, Mark paid 320 + 150 = 470 dollars.  The answer is 470. 
80% off of 400 means the radiator costs 0. 2 * 400 = 80 dollars.  So Mark has to pay 400 - 80 = 320 dollars for the radiator.  Then, Mark also has to pay the mechanic for 3 hours of work.  That's 50 * 3 = 150 dollars.  So in total Mark has to pay 320 + 150 dollars.  That is 470 dollars.  The answer is 470. 
1st step: Mark bought a new radiator from the junk shop.  He got 80% off.  400 * 0. 2 is 80 (20% discount), so he paid 400 - 80 = 320 dollars.
