[EXP] 26: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Juan and his brother Carlos sell each glass for 0. 50 and get 20 glasses per gallon.  So they make 20  0. 50 = 10 dollars per gallon.  For each gallon they make it costs 3 dollars for lemons and 2 dollars for sugar, so 3 + 2 = 5 dollars in total.  They make 10 dollars from selling and spend 5 to make.  So they make 10 - 5 = 5 dollars profit per gallon.  If they made 25 dollars in total profit, then they sold 25 / 5 = 5 gallons of lemonade.  Since they spent 3 dollars on lemons per gallon, they spent 3  5 = 15 dollars on lemons.  The answer is 15.

[EXP] 30: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 31, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day this week.  A sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.  So this week, for lunch, he used 2 x 7 = 14 slices of cheese.  For breakfast, he ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days.  For each omelet, he used one more slice of cheese than he did for a sandwich.  So for an omelet, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese.  For 3 omelets, this is 3 x 3 = 9 slices of cheese.  Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.  So in total, Carl used 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.  The answer is 31.

[EXP] 39: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 118000, [output]: 400000 is the selling price of the house. 3% of the selling price for the transfer fees is 3/100 * 400000 = 12000. 5% of the selling price for the brokerage fee is 5/100 * 400000 = 20000. 250000 is the loan amount. 400000 - 12000 - 20000 - 250000 = -105000. 105000 is negative because it's a deduction. 400000 - 105000 = 295000. 295000 is the net proceeds Mr. izzas will receive from the sale of the house.  The answer is -105000. 
[EXP] 40: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 315, [output]:  To solve this problem, let's first find the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.  The collar is one-tenth the number of stitches for the body, so it is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.  The rosette is twice the number of stitches for the collar, so it is 90 x 2 = 180 stitches.  The total number of stitches in the whole project is 900 (for the body) + 90 (for the collar) + 180 (for the rosette) = 1170 stitches.  There are 1800 stitches for the whole project, so the remaining stitches are for the two sleeves.  The two sleeves have 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches in total.  To divide these stitches evenly between the two sleeves, we can divide 630 by 2, which gives us 315 stitches for each sleeve.  The answer is 315.

[EXP] 47: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils. 3 boxes is the same as 3 x some number of pencils in each box.  We don't know how many pencils in each box yet.  But we know the total is 26.  So 3 x some number + 2 = 26.  Subtracting 2 from both sides gives 3 x some number = 24.  Dividing both sides by 3 gives some number = 8.  So each box has 8 pencils and Jam has 3 x 8 = 24 pencils.  Now we know Meg had 46 pencils.  So total pencils Jam and Meg have is 24 + 46 = 70.  The problem is not asking for the total number of pencils, but how many boxes to store them.  Since Jam had 3 boxes and each box had 8 pencils, Jam occupied 3 boxes.  To store 70 pencils, we need additional boxes.  Since each box holds 8 pencils, 70 / 8 = 8 with a remainder of 6.  A box holds 8 pencils, so we need 8 boxes to hold 64 pencils.  To hold the remaining 6 pencils we need 1 more box.  So we need 1 more box to hold the remaining 6 pencils and 8 boxes for the 64 pencils.  In total, Jam and Meg need 1 + 8 = 9 boxes to store all their pencils.  The answer is 9.

[EXP] 107: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]: 80 students in total, and 2 classes with equal number of students. 80 / 2 = 40 students in each class. 40% of the students in each class are girls. 40% is the same as 0. 40% of 40 is 0. 40 - 16 = 24. 24 students are boys in each class.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 108: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 3, [output]: 54 students need to be divided into 6 groups. 54 / 6 = 9. 1 group is formed with 9 students. 9 * 6 is 54, which means we can split the students into 6 groups exactly.  But we need 12 groups. 12 - 6 = 6. 6 more groups are needed.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 109: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]: 33 is the total number of people on the council. 33 - x is the number of votes against the new regulation and x is the number of votes in favor of the new regulation. 33 - x = x/2. 2(33 - x) = x. 66 - 2x = x. 66 = 3x. 22 = x. 22 is the number of votes in favor of the new regulation. 33 - 22 = 11, which is the number of votes against the new regulation. 22 is the answer. 
[EXP] 110: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step:

1.  The first house needs 1/2 of the second house.  If we call the number of shingles the second house needs x, then the first house needs x/2.  The total number of shingles for the first two houses is x + (x/2).  We know this plus the number of shingles for the third house needs to equal 250.  So we can set up the equation:

x + (x/2) + 2x = 250

Combine like terms:

3. 5x = 250

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 50

So the second house needs 50 cases of shingles.  The first house needs half of this, so it needs 25 cases.  Now we just need to find out how many the third house needs.  We know the third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2 x 25 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 111: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 4 vanilla scents were available. 5 of each of them were sold, so 4 * 5 = 20 vanilla scents were sold. 8 fruity scents were available. 2 of each of them were sold, so 8 * 2 = 16 fruity scents were sold. 20 - 16 is 4. 20 vanilla scents sold compared to 16 fruity scents is 4 more.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 112: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4400, [output]:  Mike has 600 movies.  A third of the movies are in various series.  A third of 600 is 200.  Mike knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  So the 200 series movies will cost 200 * $6 = $1200.  The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400 movies.  40% of 400 is 160 movies.  These are older movies and they cost $5 each.  So the cost for these 160 movies is 160 * $5 = $800.  Mike also needs to buy the remaining movies at their full price of $10 each.  There are 400 - 160 = 240 movies left.  This will cost 240 * $10 = $2400.  The total cost of buying all the movies is 1200 + 800 + 2400 = $4400.  The answer is $\boxed{\ 4400}$. 
[EXP] 113: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 1 gallon is enough for 10 miles. 10 miles per day for Monday to Friday is a total of 10 * 5 = 50 miles. 50 miles / 10 miles per gallon means Andy consumes 5 gallons per week. 5 gallons * 3 dollars per gallon is 15 dollars.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 114: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  The train has 172 people initially. 47 people get off, so there are 172 - 47 = 125 people left. 13 people get on, so there are 125 + 13 = 138 people. 38 people get off, so there are 138 - 38 = 100 people.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 115: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  When Billy first started, he was paid $10 per hour. 2 months later he got a raise of $0. 5 per hour, so his new rate is $10 + 0. 5 = $10. 5 per hour.  Then he got another raise of $1. 0 per hour on his anniversary, so his final rate is $10. 5 + 1. 0 = $11. 5 per hour.  Sally's starting salary is $0. 5 more than Billy's starting salary, which was $10. 0 per hour.  So Sally's starting salary is $10. 5 + 0. 5 = $11. 0 per hour.  Since they both work 20 hours, Billy will earn $11. 5 * 20 = $230.  For Sally, her hourly wage is $11. 0, so she will earn $11. 0 * 20 = $220.  Billy will earn $230 - $220 = $10 more than Sally.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 116: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1170, [output]:  James started with the sum of the cost of the diamond and the gold, which is 600 + 300 = 900 dollars.  He then paid a 30% premium.  To find 30% of 900, you can multiply 900 by 0. 30 = 270.  So he paid 900 + 270 = 1170 dollars in total.  The answer is 1170. 
[EXP] 117: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 79, [output]: 3 flowers with 5 petals each have a total of 3 x 5 = 15 petals. 4 flowers with 6 petals each have a total of 4 x 6 = 24 petals. 5 flowers with 4 petals each have a total of 5 x 4 = 20 petals. 6 flowers with 7 petals each have a total of 6 x 7 = 42 petals.  In total they have 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.  On the way to the vase, she drops 1 of each flower, so in total she loses 1 x 5 petals + 1 x 6 petals + 1 x 4 petals + 1 x 7 petals = 18 petals.  101 - 18 = 83 petals left.  The answer is 83. 
[EXP] 118: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6,250, [output]: 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 dollars was raised by the students. 20 students equally share the amount. 125,000 / 20 = 6,250. 6,250 dollars was raised by each student.  The answer is 6,250. 
[EXP] 119: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]:  Cindy started with 5 green eggs.  She has twice as many blue eggs, so 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs.  She has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  And she has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.  To get the total number of eggs, we add them all up: 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27.  The answer is 27. 
[EXP] 120: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step:

* Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch
* Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 x 1 = 12 inches
* Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 x 12 = 48 inches
* Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 x 48 = 480 inches

To convert inches to feet, we can divide the total inches by 12 (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot):

480 inches ÷ 12 = 40 feet

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 121: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's first find the remaining lengths of each glue stick and then add them together.  For the first glue stick, it has 1/6 left, so it has 1/6 * 12 = 2 millimeters left.  For the second glue stick, it has 2/3 left, so it has 2/3 * 12 = 8 millimeters left.  For the third glue stick, it has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters left.  Adding the remaining lengths together: 2 + 8 + 6 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 122: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 975, [output]:  Brenda started with 300 dollars. 3/4 of 300 is 225. 225 is the amount of simple interest she earns in the first year. 300 + 225 = 525. 525 is the new balance. 3/4 of 525 is 393. 393 is the interest earned in the second year. 525 + 393 = 918. 918 is the new balance. 3/4 of 918 is 274. 274 is the interest earned in the third year. 918 + 274 = 1192.  The answer is 1192.

The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let Jean's age be j.  Paul is 10 years older than John, so Paul's age is j + 10.  Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age, which is (j + 10) + j = 2j + 10.  Since the combined age of all 3 is 100, the sum of their ages is 100.  j + (j + 10) + (2j + 10) = 100.  Combining like terms, 4j + 20 = 100.  Subtracting 20 from both sides, 4j = 80.  Dividing both sides by 4, j = 20.  Paul's age is j + 10 = 30, John's age is j = 20, and Peter's age is (j + 10) + j = 30 + 20 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 135: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  First, let's find out how much money John earned:

50 dollars an hour * 6 hours = 50 * 6 = 300 dollars

John spent 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.  He also wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, which leaves him with 250 - 100 = 150 dollars.  John can use this money to buy pens.  Each pen costs 25 dollars, so John can buy 150 / 25 = 6 pens.  (150 / 25 = 6, because 6 * 25 = 150).  John also wants to buy 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he needs 10 * 5 = 50 dollars for the pencils.  He has 150 dollars left, so he has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left to buy pens after buying the pencils.  He can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens with this money.  In total, he can buy 6 + 4 = 10 pens.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 136: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]: 1) James has to swim 20 miles total. 60% of 20 is 0. 6 * 20 = 12.  So far, he has swum 12 miles. 2) To find the time it took to swim 12 miles, we do 12 / 2 = 6 hours. 3) James rests for half that time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. 4) Then he swims the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.  He goes at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. 5) To find the time it took to swim 8 miles, we do 8 / 1 = 8 hours. 6) Add up the time it took to swim 12 miles, rest, and swim 8 miles. 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.  The answer is 17 hours.

[EXP] 147: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, we can assume that each large stuffed animal costs 3*4 = 12 dollars.  The total earnings from the sales, $120, is the sum of the earnings from the small and large stuffed animals.  Let's call the number of small stuffed animals x.  Then, the number of large stuffed animals is x/2, since Teresa sold twice as many small as large.  The earnings from the small ones is x*4 = 4x.  The earnings from the large ones is 12x/2 = 6x.  The total earnings are 4x + 6x = 10x.  This must be equal to $120, so 10x = 120.  Solving for x, we get x = 12.  So Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 148: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]:  Sally started with a total of 25 + 7 + 12 = 44 balloons. 40% of the red balloons burst, so 0. 4 x 25 = 10 red balloons burst. 44 - 10 = 34 balloons remaining.

[EXP] 154: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 251, [output]:  The party fee for renting the theater is $125.  We know that there were originally 20 people invited.  Then 25 classmates and 7 girls in her dance class were invited.  That is a total of 25 + 7 = 32 guests.  Adding 13 family members, there are 13 + 32 = 45 guests.  Since 4 people said they could not come, the actual number of people at the party is 45 - 4 = 41.  Since the fee is $6 for each additional guest above 20, we subtract 20 from the total number of guests to find the number of extra guests, 41 - 20 = 21.  The number of extra guests, 21, times the cost of each extra guest, $6, is 21 x 6 = 126.  Adding the $6 per extra guest to the base fee of $125, the total cost of the party is $125 + $126 = $251.  The answer is $251. 
[EXP] 155: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Melanie has 12 weeks worth of toothpicks (10 per week for 12 weeks = 12 x 10 = 120). 200 - 120 = 80 more toothpicks are needed. 80 / 10 = 8. 8 weeks are needed to collect 80 toothpicks. 8 weeks more will make it 12 + 8 = 20 weeks.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 156: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]:  The crocodile grows 8 inches every 4 years.  So it will grow 8 / 4 = 2 inches every year.  After 13 years, it will grow a total of 13 * 2 = 26 inches.  The answer is 26. 
[EXP] 157: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1080, [output]: 1/2 of a small triceratops was eaten by the T-Rex. 1/2 of what is left was eaten by the velociraptors. 1/2 of 1/2 is 1/4. 1/4 of the original triceratops was eaten by the velociraptors. 1 - 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4 was left. 1/4 was gobbled up by the Allosaurus. 1/4 = 270. 1 = 4 * 270 = 1080. 1080 is the original amount of kilograms of meat.  The answer is 1080. 
[EXP] 158: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  To find the time it takes to slide down each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the rate at speed at which the slide.  For the biggest slide, it will take 300 feet ÷ 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes to slide.  For the second-biggest slide, it will take 240 feet ÷ 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.  To find the difference in time, we take 5-3 = 2.  So it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 159: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 100 centimeters are originally given. 100 / 4 = 25 because we need to cut 100 into 4 equal parts. 25 centimeters is each of the main cuts. 25 must be cut into 5 parts. 25 / 5 = 5. 5 centimeters is the length of each final cut.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 160: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: -3, [output]:  The temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. 8 degrees less overnight, so 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius.  Then it increased by 3 degrees in the morning, so -6 + 3 = -3.  The answer is -3. 
[EXP] 161: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 560, [output]:  John visits his parents 2 times in a month.  It's a round trip, so it's 2 times the distance of a one-way trip.  One way, it's 2 hours at 70 mph, which is 2 x 70 = 140 miles.  For the round trip, it's 140 x 2 = 280 miles.  He drives that distance 2 times a month, so the total distance is 280 x 2 = 560.  The answer is 560. 
[EXP] 162: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 750, [output]:  Let's start with the average car, which goes 120 miles per hour.  We know the second fastest car is 5 times faster, so it goes 120 x 5 = 600 miles per hour.  The fastest car is 1. 25 times faster than the second fastest car, so it goes 600 x 1. 25 = 750 miles per hour.  The answer is 750. 
[EXP] 163: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Jane has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks, so she has a total of 4 x 8 = 32 dollars already. 60 - 32 = 28 dollars more she needs to save. 28/4 = 7. 7 weeks are needed to save the remaining 28 dollars.  Since Jane has already saved for 8 weeks, the total number of weeks will be 8 + 7 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 164: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 20, [output]: 3 eggs a day for 30 days is 3 * 30 = 90 eggs. 90 eggs / 12 = 7. 5 eggs a day for 30 days is 5 * 30 = 150 eggs. 150 eggs / 12 is 12. 7 + 12 = 19 dozens. 1 dozen = 12 eggs. 19 * 12 = 228 eggs. 228 eggs = 19 dozens. 228 eggs/12 = 19. 19 dozen eggs.  The answer is 19. 
[EXP] 165: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]: 3 dozen eggs means 3 x 12 = 36 eggs. 4 children will eat eggs equally. 36 ÷ 4 = 9.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 166: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 13, [output]:  The second song is 60% longer than the first song, so it is 1. 6 times the length of the first song.  The first song took 5 minutes, so the second song took 5 * 1. 6 = 7. 5 minutes.  The total time of the cassette is the sum of the times of the two songs, which is 5 + 7. 5 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 167: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Since Haley is 26 years old, half of her age is 26/2 = 13 years old.  Geb is 10 less than this, so he is 13 - 10 = 3 years old.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 168: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Ronnie was given $5.  Rissa was given three times as much, so Rissa was given 3 * 5 = 15.  After each of them gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, we don't have enough information to figure out how much they had left, but we can calculate how much Ronnie had left.  We know that Rissa was left with 4/5 of her money.  Rissa started with 15 dollars, so 4/5 of 15 is 12.  She must have given 15 - 12 = 3 dollars to their little sister.  Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount, so Ronnie must have given 3 dollars too.  Ronnie started with 5 dollars and gave 3 away, so he has 5 - 3 = 2 dollars left.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 169: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 5 inches is the original length of the chalk. 20% of 5 is 1. 45% of 5 is 2. 5 - 2 is 3, so the teacher still has 3 inches of chalk. 3 inches are 3/5 of the original. 3/5 simplified is 3/5. 5/5 is 1, so 1/5 is the amount the teacher uses each day if he goes back to 20%. 3 divided by 1/5 is 15 days.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 170: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 11, [output]: 2 apples fell initially. 1 apple landed on Newton's head, so he picked up 2 apples. 1 apple went back into the tree and caused 5 more to fall. 2 + 5 = 7 apples. 6 of these apples were put in his pocket. 1 apple was thrown at the tree, and this caused 6 more apples to fall. 5 (already in pocket) + 1 (added to pocket) = 6 apples in pocket. 6 + 1 (just added) = 7 apples picked up. 2 (initial apples) + 7 = 9 apples he picked up initially. 1 apple was not picked up, so he picked up 9 - 1 = 8 apples. 8 apples he picked up, but 6 were in his pocket, so he brought home 8 - 6 = 2 apples. 2 apples in his pocket. 2 + 2 (initially fell and were picked up) = 4. 2 apples he brought home.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 171: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 19, [output]: 50 bandages come in a bulk pack. 38 bandages were used on the first day, and one bulk pack was ordered. 50 - 38 = 12 bandages are left from the pack. 38 + 12 = 50 started with that day. 10 fewer bandages were used on the second day. 38 - 10 = 28 bandages were used on the second day. 50 - 28 = 22 bandages were left after the second day. 2 bulk packs were ordered on the third day and only half a pack was used. 50 * 2 = 100 bandages were ordered, of which 50 / 2 = 25 were used. 22 + 25 = 47 bandages were left before the bulk pack was ordered. 50 bandages come in a bulk pack, so the difference between the difference between the total and remaining bandages is the number of bandages used on the third day. 78 - 47 = 31 bandages used on the third day. 22 + 25 + 31 = 78 bandages originally, but we are asked for the number of bandages on the first day. 50 bandages were ordered and used on the first day. 78 - 50 = 28. 28 bandages were used on the first day. 50 - 38 = 12 remained. 12 + 28 is the number of bandages the nurses started with. 12 + 28 is 40.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 172: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2400, [output]: 10 bottles of scotch cost $600.  Scott per bottle is 600 divided by 10, which is 60 dollars.  Cognac is twice as many bottles as scotch, so John buys 20 bottles.  Cognac costs 50% more than scotch, so it is 60 x 1. 5 = 90 dollars per bottle.  The total cost for cognac is 20 x 90 = 1800.  Total cost for everything is scotch cost + cognac cost, which is 600 + 1800 = 2400.  The answer is 2400. 
[EXP] 173: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 168, [output]: 700 shells were found originally. 40% of the shells were found by Team Alphas. 40% of 700 is 0. 40 x 7 = 280. 700 - 280 is 420. 420 shells were left. 60% of the remaining shells were found by Team The Finders. 60% of 420 is 0. 60 x 4. 2 = 240. 420 - 240 is 180. 180 shells were left. 700 - 280 - 240 = 180. 180 shells were found by team Gogetters. 180 is the answer.

[EXP] 175: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 225, [output]: 10 students in each grade, and there are 4 grades, so there are a total of 10 * 4 = 40 students. 8 students at a time can try the escape room, so it will take 40 / 8 = 5 groups to try the escape room. 45 minutes per group, so the total time will be 5 * 45 = 225 minutes. 225 / 60 is 3. 75. 3 hours and 75 minutes. 3 hours and 75 minutes. 3 and 3/4 hours.  The answer is 3 and 3/4 hours. 
[EXP] 176: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Let's start by using some variables! Let's say that the number of cupcakes that Carly made is "x".  Carly's problem statement tells us that she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.  Let's write that as "3x-2".  She makes a total of 5 x 2 = 10 treats.  Since 5 people each take 2 treats, we know that the total number of treats made must be equal to 10.  We can create an equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.  First, we need to simplify the equation by combining like terms: x + 3x - 2 = 10.  When you simplify this, it becomes 4x - 2 = 10.  If we add 2 to both sides, we get 4x = 12.  If we divide both sides by 4, we get x = 3.  Since x is the number of cupcakes, Carly made 3 cupcakes.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 177: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Eve started with 20 pieces of pomelos. 1/4 of 20 is 5. 20 - 5 = 15. 15 is how many she had after giving some away. 20 - 15 = 5. 5 pomelos were given away.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 178: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 50, [output]: 80 classrooms at 15 minutes each will be 80 x 15 = 1200 minutes. 1200 minutes is equal to 20 hours. 20 hours out of an 8 hour workday is 20/8 = 2. 2/1 is 200%. 200% is equivalent to 100%, so they spend 100% of their day cleaning classrooms. 100% out of a workday is 100/8 = 12. 12 hours out of an 8 hour workday is not possible, so that is not the right answer. 
[EXP] 179: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3360, [output]: 4 years ago Ara started playing. 4 years later, she will have played 4 * 40 = 160 games. 160 games with 21 points each will be 160 * 21 = 3360 points.  The answer is 3360.

[EXP] 184: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Dexter has 5 pigs that eat 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats a total of 4 x 2 = 8 pounds per day. 5 pigs will eat a total of 5 x 8 = 40 pounds per day. 40 pounds per day, for 7 days (since a week has 7 days) is 40 x 7 = 280 pounds. 300 pounds of feed were ordered, and 280 pounds were eaten. 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 185: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 34, [output]:  First, let's find the amount of time she spends on meditation each day.  She spends 15 minutes * 2 times a day = 30 minutes a day on meditation.  Since she practices meditation and yoga 5 days a week, in a week she spends 5 * 30 = 150 minutes on meditation.  In 4 weeks, she will spend 4 * 150 = 600 minutes on meditation.  She also practices 1 hour or 60 minutes of yoga 5 days a week.  In a week she will do 5 * 60 = 300 minutes of yoga.  In 4 weeks, she will do 4 * 300 = 1200 minutes of yoga.  So in total, she has spent 600 + 1200 = 1800 minutes on meditation and yoga practice.  The answer is 1800.
