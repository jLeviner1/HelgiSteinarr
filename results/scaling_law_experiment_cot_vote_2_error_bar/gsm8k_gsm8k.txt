25% of these 16 students enrolled in jazz dance.  That's 0. 25 x 16 = 4 students.  

So, 16 - 4 = 12 students are left.  These 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance. 

The question asks for the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance.  The number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 12, and the total number of students in the class is 20.  So the percentage is:

(12 / 20) x 100 = 60%

The answer is 60. 
20% of students enrolled in contemporary dance.  This is 20% of 20, or 20 / 100 * 20 = 4 students. 

20 students minus 4 contemporary dance students leave 20 - 4 = 16 students remaining. 

25% of these remaining students enrolled in jazz dance.  This is 25% of 16, or 16 / 100 * 25 = 4 students. 

So, the number of students in jazz dance is 4, and the remaining students are 16 - 4 = 12 students. 

This means that 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = 15.  So the team won 15 games. 
 Let's start by using the information that the team played 22 games.  If they won 8 more games than they lost, that means the number of losses is the same as the number of wins, minus 8. 

Let's say the number of wins is x.  Then, the number of losses is x - 8, since they won 8 more games than they lost. 

The total number of games played is 22, so we can set up the equation: x + (x - 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x - 8 = 22

Add 8 to both sides: 2x = 30

Divide both sides by 2: x = 15

[EXP] 52: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Morgan's dad said she had $90.  She wants to spend money on mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts.  A round of mini-golf is $5 and she wants to play with herself and some friends, so that's $5 * (number of friends + 1).  Arcade tokens are $5, so that's $5.  Go-karts are $10 a ride and she wants to ride twice with each friend, so that's $10 * 2 * (number of friends).  Total cost is 5 * (number of friends + 1) + 5 + 20 * (number of friends).  We know Morgan has $90, so we can set up an equation. 

5 * (number of friends + 1) + 5 + 20 * (number of friends) = 90

Combine like terms:

5 * (number of friends) + 25 + 20 * (number of friends) = 90

Combine like terms:

25 * (number of friends) + 25 = 90

Subtract 25 from both sides:

25 * (number of friends) = 65

Divide both sides by 25:

number of friends = 65 / 25

number of friends = 2. 6

Since you can't invite a fraction of a friend, Morgan can invite 2 friends. 
 Morgan started with a budget of 90 dollars.  She wants to play 1 round of mini-golf, which is 5 dollars, get 5 dollars of arcade tokens, and go-kart twice, which costs 10 * 2 = 20 dollars.  So it will cost 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 dollars.  She will have 90 - 30 = 60 dollars left over.  If she wants to split it evenly among her friends, she can invite an equal number of friends for her to split the remaining 60 dollars.  Let's call the number of friends x.  Each friend will get 60/x dollars.  We know that the number of friends will take away all the remaining budget, so the total will be 60.  60 = x * (60/x).  Let's simplify.  60 = 60.  The answer is that Morgan can invite any number of friends without running out of budget.

 Kenny needs $100 to go to the amusement park.  He started with some amount of cards.  He sold some of them and has $50 left.  This $50 must have come from selling the cards, since he kept 1/3 of them.  So, he must have sold 2/3 of the cards.  Let's call the number of cards 'x'.  Then, he sold 2/3x cards for $1. 5 each, which is 2x/3 x $1. 5 = $x.  This is equal to $100 - $50 = $50, since he had $50 left over.  $x = $50, so x is 50.  This means that Kenny started with 50 cards. 
 Voted result:  Kenny has a collection of cards that he will sell for 1. 5 dollars each.  He kept 1/3 of the cards, which means he sold 2/3 of them.  He also got 50 dollars in cash after the sale.  Since each card sells for 1. 5 dollars, he must have sold 2/3 * x = 50 / 1. 5 dollars worth of cards.  This means:

(2/3)x = 50 / 1. 5
2x = 50 * 3 / 1. 5
2x = 100
x = 50

So Kenny started with 50 cards. 
[EXP] 63: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Let's start with the amount of money George had left: 1% of $5 is $0. 05.  He spent $5 - $0. 05 = $4. 95.  So he spent $4. 95 on chips and candy bars. 

Chips cost 40 cents each, so he must have bought: $4. 95 / 0. 40 = 12. 38 (but since you can't buy a fraction of a chip, he must have bought 12 chips). 

The total cost of the chips is 12 * 0. 40 = $4. 80.  So George must have spent $4. 95 - $4. 80 = $0. 15 on candy bars. 

Candy bars cost 75 cents each, so he must have bought: $0. 15 / 0. 75 = 0. 2 (round up, since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar).  George bought 1 candy bar. 

The answer is 1.

[EXP] 86: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Let's say Jerry's current age is x.  Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives:

x = 10

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

The answer is 13. 
 Let's start by using the information that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago.  This means that if he is currently x years old, he was x/2 years old 5 years ago.  Since he is currently x years old, this means the equation x = x/2 + 5 can be formed.  Solving for x, we get x = 10.

[EXP] 94: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2100, [output]:  Let's start by letting x be the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month. 

The problem states that half of the amount earned from green hats in the first month was the sales of red hats, so the sales of red hats was $400.  You can set up an equation to represent this:

0. 5x = 400

To solve for x, multiply both sides by 2:

x = 800

So Ariadne earned $800 from selling green hats in the first month. 

The problem also states that the sales from green hats in the second month was 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.  You can find the sales from green hats in the second month by multiplying the total sales of the first month by 3/4:

Total sales of the first month = x = $800
Sales from green hats in the second month = x*(3/4) = 800*(3/4) = $600

The total amount Ariadne earned in two months is the total amount she earned from the first month plus the total amount she earned from the second month:

Total amount earned in two months = x + x*(3/4) = 800 + 600 = $1400

The answer is 1400.

[EXP] 108: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 3, [output]: 54 students are to be put into 6 groups of equal size.  The size of each group is 54 ÷ 6 = 9.  If we need 12 groups, we need a total of 12 x 9 = 108 students to fill the groups.  Since we only have 54 students, we are short 108 - 54 = 54 students.  To answer the question, we need to form 54 more groups. 
54 students are to be divided into 6 groups originally.  In each group, there are 54 / 6 = 9 students.  To make 12 groups, the number of students per group becomes 54 / 12 = 4. 5.  But this is not possible.  So the needed number of groups should be near to 6.  The closest is 9 groups.  So, 54 / 9 = 6 groups happen naturally.  6 < 12, so extra groups are needed.  12 - 6 = 6.  6 groups more are needed.

[EXP] 109: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]: 33 people are on the council.  The vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it.  So, let's say the number of votes against the regulation is x.  Then the number of votes in favor of the regulation is 2x. 

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

So there were 11 votes against the regulation.  There were twice as many votes in favor of the regulation, so the number of votes in favor was:

2x = 2(11) = 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.  The answer is 22.

[EXP] 110: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say the second house needs x cases of shingles. 

The first house needs 1/2 of the second house, so it needs 1/2x cases of shingles. 

The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2(1/2x) = x cases of shingles. 

The total number of cases needed is 250, which is the sum of the cases needed for each house: x + 1/2x + x = 250

Combine like terms: 3/2x = 250

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 3x = 500

Divide both sides by 3: x = 166. 67

Since we can't have a fraction of a case, we round up to the nearest whole number.  x is approximately 167. 

The second house needs 167 cases of shingles. 

The first house needs half of that, which is 167 / 2 = 83. 5.  Since we can't have a fraction of a case, we round up to the nearest whole number.  The first house needs 84 cases of shingles.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 x 2 = 4 balls. 


The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.  Since all the coach's basketballs were picked up in one trip, the number of balls the coach brought must be the same as the number the boys carried.  Therefore, the coach brought 7 balls to practice. 
 Let's say Jeffrey picked up x balls.  Since Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey, Jason picked up 2x balls.  Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, so Jordan picked up 2*2x = 4x balls.  Since Jason picked up 2 balls, x + 2 + 4x = 5x = 2.  So x = 2/5.  This means Jeffrey picked up 2/5 balls, Jason picked up 2 * 2/5 = 4/5 balls, and Jordan picked up 4 * 2/5 = 8/5 balls.  To find the total number of balls, add up the number of balls each boy picked up: 8/5 + 4/5 + 2 = 14/5.  Since Coach said the three boys picked up all the balls in one trip, this means they picked up the total number of balls.  If the total number of balls the coach brought is x, then 14/5 = x - 1 (since they picked up all the balls from the one bag).  Therefore, x = 1 + 14/5 = 19/5.  Since Coach brought one bag of basketballs to practice, this means x = 19.  Coach brought 19 basketballs to practice.

[EXP] 147: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

1.  Teresa sells large stuffed animals for 3 times the price of small stuffed animals.  Let's call the price of a small stuffed animal x.  So, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x. 
2.  She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so let's call the number of small stuffed animals 2n and the number of large stuffed animals n. 
3.  The total amount of money she earned was $120, and the total price of the small stuffed animals is 2nx$4.  The total price of the large stuffed animals is nx(3x) = 3nx. 
4.  The total amount earned is the sum of the price of small and large stuffed animals: 2nx * 4 + 3nx = 120. 
5.  Combine like terms: 2nx(4) + 3nx = 120 -> 8nx + 3nx = 120 -> 11nx = 120. 
6.  Now, divide both sides by 11: nx = 120 / 11. 
7.  So, n is 11, since the number of small stuffed animals is twice the number of large ones. 
8.  The number of small stuffed animals is 2n = 2(11) = 22. 

The answer is 22. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Since we are given that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, let's say the cost of a small stuffed animal is x (which is $4).  Then, the cost of a large stuffed animal would be 3x. 

Also, since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, let's say the number of large stuffed animals is L and the number of small stuffed animals is 2L. 

The problem states that Teresa earned $120 from the sales.  Since the cost of a small stuffed animal is $4, the cost of 1 small stuffed animal is $4.  So, the cost of 2L small stuffed animals would be 2L * 4 = 8L. 

The cost of L large stuffed animals would be L * 3x = 3Lx. 

The total revenue earned by Teresa would be the sum of the revenue from small and large stuffed animals.  So, we can set up the equation as:

8L + 3Lx = 120

Since we are given that the revenue is $120, we can substitute 120 for the right-hand side of the equation:

8L + 3Lx = 120

To solve for L, we can isolate L on one side of the equation by subtracting 8L from both sides:

3Lx = 120 - 8L

Next, we can add 8L to both sides to get:

3Lx + 8L = 120

This simplifies to:

11Lx = 120

Now, we can divide both sides by 11 to solve for L:

Lx = 120 / 11

Lx = 10. 909090909 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a stuffed animal, we can round L to the nearest whole number.  In this case, L would be 11. 

So, Teresa sold 11 large stuffed animals and 2 times more small stuffed animals, which is 2 * 11 = 22 small stuffed animals.  The answer is 22.

A group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat, which is what was left after the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. 

So, the Tyrannosaurus rex must have eaten half of the original amount, and then the velociraptors took half of what was left.  So, the original amount was 2 times what the velociraptors took, and 4 times what the Allosaurs got. 

Let x be the amount of meat the velociraptors took.  Then, x + x = 2x, which is what the Allosaurs got.  And the T-Rex ate half of it initially, so 2x / 2 = x, which is what the velociraptors took. 

The velociraptors took half of what was left, and that is x.  The Allosaurs took x, which means half of it was x.  If the Allosaurs took 270, then 2x = 270, and x = 135. 

So the velociraptors took 135, and the T-Rex ate half of the original amount.  Since the velociraptors took 135, and they took half of what was left, the original amount must have been 2 x 135 = 270.

[EXP] 168: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Ronnie was given 5 dollars.  Rissa was given 3 times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given 5 x 3 = 15 dollars.  After each giving an equal amount to their little sister, they both gave away some money.  Let x be the amount of money they gave away.  Then Ronnie had 5 - x and Rissa had 15 - x money left.  Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, which is 4/5 x (15 - x).  

Since it's equal, 5 - x = 4/5 x (15 - x).  We can solve for x.  

First, simplify 4/5 x (15 - x) by distributing the multiplication: 4/5 * 15 - 4/5 * x = 12 - 4/5 * x 

Then set up the equation:

5 - x = 12 - 4/5 * x

Subtract 5 from both sides: -x = -3 - 4/5 * x

Add 4/5 * x to both sides: -x + 4/5 * x = -3

The terms with x cancel out: - 4/5 * x = -3

Multiply both sides by -1: 4/5 * x = 3

Multiply both sides by 5 and then divide by 4: x = 15/4

x = 3. 75

So Ronnie and Rissa gave away 3. 75 dollars.  Ronnie had 5 - 3. 75 dollars left, which is 1. 25 dollars.  The answer is 1. 25.

First, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.  Let's call the number of cupcakes she made "c".  Then, the number of brownies she made is 3c - 2. 

Since each person gets two treats, and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 x 5 = 10. 

We know that the total number of treats is equal to the number of cupcakes plus the number of brownies: c + (3c - 2) = 10

Simplify the equation: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. 
 Let's start by using the information that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.  Let's call the number of cupcakes she makes "x".  Then the number of brownies she makes is 3x - 2.  

Since each person gets two treats, the total number of treats made is 2 x 5 = 10.  Since there are both cupcakes and brownies, the total number of treats must equal the sum of the cupcakes and brownies: 

x + (3x - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4x = 12

Divide by 4:

x = 3
