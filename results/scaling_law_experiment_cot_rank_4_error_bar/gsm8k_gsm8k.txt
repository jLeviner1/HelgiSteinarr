Let's first find out how much they spent on lemons and sugar.  We know that the total profit is $25. 

The cost of lemons and sugar for each gallon is $3 (for lemons) + $2 (for sugar) = $5. 

For each gallon, they can make 20 glasses.  Each glass is sold for $0. 50, so the total revenue from one gallon of lemonade is 20 glasses x $0. 50 = $10. 

The profit is the revenue minus the cost, so the profit from one gallon of lemonade is $10 - $5 = $5. 

Since the total profit is $25, and the profit from one gallon is $5, the number of gallons they made is:

25 (total profit) ÷ 5 (profit per gallon) = 5 gallons

For 5 gallons, the total cost of lemons is 5 gallons x $3 (cost per gallon) = $15. 

Therefore, Juan and Carlos spent $15 on lemons.

[EXP] 83: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 37, [output]:  Let's break down the costs:

* Bread: Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, and they spend $3. 00 per loaf.  So the cost of bread is $3. 00 per 10 sandwiches. 

* Cheese and condiments: The cost is $30. 00 per 10 sandwiches. 

Total cost per 10 sandwiches: $3. 00 (bread) + $30. 00 (cheese and condiments) = $33. 00

Now, let's calculate the revenue:

* They sell each sandwich for $7. 00, and they sold 10 sandwiches. 

Revenue: 10 sandwiches x $7. 00 per sandwich = $70. 00

Now, let's calculate the net profit:

Net profit = Revenue - Total cost
= $70. 00 (revenue) - $33. 00 (total cost)
= $37. 00

The answer is $37. 00.

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation was twice that of the votes against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x. \n\nThere are 33 people on the council, and each person's vote counts as one.  So, the total number of votes is equal to 33.  We can set up an equation based on this:\n\nx + 2x = 33\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3x = 33\n\nDivide by 3:\n\nx = 11\n\nSo, there were 11 votes against the new regulation.  Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation was twice that of the votes against, the number of votes in favor is:\n\n2x = 2(11) = 22\n\nThe answer is 22. "]
[EXP] 110: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

1.  If the first house needs 1/2 of the second, that means the first house needs x cases and the second house needs 2x cases. 
2.  The total number of cases for all three houses is 250.  So, x + 2x + (2x) = 250. 
3.  Simplify the equation: 5x = 250. 
4.  Divide both sides by 5: x = 50. 
5.  Now we know the second house needs 2x = 2(50) = 100 cases. 
6.  The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2x = 2(50) = 100 cases. 

The answer is 100.

[EXP] 133: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 1) There are 3 ways to solve this problem.  One way is by counting.  Counting the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours: 8 hours/4 hours per trip = 2 trips.  So in 2 trips, the sloth will have 2 * [unknown # of berries] = 24 berries.  
The least common multiple of 2 and 24 is 24.  So the unknown # of berries per trip is 24 / 2 = 12. 

The other way is by equations.  Let "n" be the number of berries the sloth collects on each trip.  After 8 hours, the sloth collects 24 berries.  The time (8 hours) is equal to the number of trips times the time per trip (4 hours), so the number of trips is 8 / 4 = 2.  

So 2 trips x [number of berries per trip] = 24.  The number of berries per trip is 24 / 2 = 12.

[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break it down:

1.  Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so Paul's age = Jean's age + 10. 
2.  Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, so Peter's age = Paul's age + Jean's age. 
3.  The sum of Peter, Paul and Jean's age is 100, so we can set up the equation:
   Peter's age + Paul's age + Jean's age = 100
4.  Substitute the expressions for Paul's age and Peter's age from (1) and (2) into the equation:
   (Paul's age + Jean's age) + Paul's age + Jean's age = 100
   2(Paul's age) + 2(Jean's age) = 100
   Paul's age + Jean's age = 50
5.  Now we know Paul's age = Jean's age + 10, so substitute this into the equation:
   (Jean's age + 10) + Jean's age = 50
   2(Jean's age) + 10 = 50
   2(Jean's age) = 40
   Jean's age = 20
   Paul's age = Jean's age + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
6.  Now we know Peter's age = Paul's age + Jean's age = 30 + 20 = 50. 

The answer is 50.

The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, which means they ate x/4 (since x/2 is now being halved again). 

The remaining weight after the velociraptors ate is x/4. 

The Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms, which is the remaining weight. 

So, we can set up the equation: x/4 = 270

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4: x = 270 * 4

x = 1080

So, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate. 

The answer is 1080.

[EXP] 185: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 34, [output]:  Let's first calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation each day. 

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes before sleep, which is a total of 15 + 15 = 30 minutes per day. 

Now, let's calculate the total time she spends on yoga practice each day:

Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour, which is 60 minutes per day. 

Now, let's calculate the total time she spends on meditation and yoga practice each day:

30 minutes (meditation) + 60 minutes (yoga) = 90 minutes per day

Since she does this 5 days a week, the total time she spends on meditation and yoga practice per week is:

90 minutes/day × 5 days/week = 450 minutes per week

Now, let's calculate the total time she spends on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks:

450 minutes/week × 4 weeks = 1800 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to hours:

1800 minutes ÷ 60 = 30 hours

The answer is 30 hours.

[EXP] 186: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Ryan started with allowance, which is 6 dollars each week.  He worked for 3 weeks, so he earned 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.  

He then bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, which is a total of 4 cones x 1. 25 = 5 dollars.  

So he had 18 dollars and spent 5 dollars, leaving him with 18 - 5 = 13 dollars.  

The problem asks how many movie tickets Ryan can buy.  Movie tickets cost 6. 50 each.  We can divide 13 by 6. 50 to find how many tickets he can buy.  13 / 6. 50 = 2.  The answer is 2.
