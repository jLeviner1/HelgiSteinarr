The problem states that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so we can set up the equation 4x = 400.  To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4: x = 400/4 = 100. 

So David does 100 pounds of laundry, and Sarah does 4 times as much, or 400 pounds. 

The problem also states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.  Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, Raymond does half of that, which is 400/2 = 200 pounds of laundry. 

The question asks for the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do.  We can calculate this by subtracting the amount of laundry David does from the amount Raymond does: 200 - 100 = 100.

[EXP] 13: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  If a football team played 22 games and they won 8 more than they lost, let's start by using a variable to represent the number of games they lost.  Let's say they lost x games. 

Since they won 8 more than they lost, that means they won x + 8 games. 

The total number of games they played is 22, so the sum of the games they won and the games they lost is equal to 22:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So the team lost 7 games.  To find the number of games they won, we add 8 to the number of games they lost:

x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

[EXP] 27: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 23, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step:

1.  Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
   So, Mark's age 2 years ago was 5 years plus half of Jan's age 2 years ago. 
   Let's call Jan's age 2 years ago 'j'.  Then half of 'j' is 'j/2'. 
   So, Mark's age 2 years ago was 5 + j/2. 
2.  But Mark's age 2 years ago was M - 2, since 2 years have passed. 
   So, M - 2 = 5 + j/2. 
   'M' is unknown, so we'll work with this equation: M - 2 = 5 + j/2. 
3.  Jan's age is currently 30. 
   So, her age 2 years ago was 30 - 2 = 28. 
   The expression 'j' is Jan's age 2 years ago, which is 28. 
4.  Now, we can plug in the known value of 'j' in the equation we created in step 2. 
   M - 2 = 5 + 28/2  (Since j is 28)
   M - 2 = 5 + 14  (28/2 is 14)
   M - 2 = 19
   M = 21  (Adding 2 to both sides)
5.  Jean is 2 years older than Mark. 
   So, Jean's age is 2 years more than Mark's age. 
   Since Mark's age is 21, Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23. 
   The answer is 23. 
 Voted result: [" Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1.  Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. \n   So, Mark's age 2 years ago was 5 years plus half of Jan's age 2 years ago. \n   Let's call Jan's age 2 years ago 'j'.  Then half of 'j' is 'j/2'. \n   So, Mark's age 2 years ago was 5 + j/2. \n2.  But Mark's age 2 years ago was M - 2, since 2 years have passed. \n   So, M - 2 = 5 + j/2. \n   'M' is unknown, so we'll work with this equation: M - 2 = 5 + j/2. \n3.

Then the number of pencils in 3 boxes is 3x.  The equation to solve is:

x + x + x + 2 = 26
3x + 2 = 26

Subtract 2 from both sides:

x + x + x + 2 = 26
3x + 2 = 26

x = 8

She wants to play 1 round of mini-golf, buy 5 dollars of arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts 2 times.  So she will spend 5 dollars on mini-golf, 5 dollars on tokens, and 2 x 10 = 20 dollars on go-karts.  So she will spend 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 dollars on those things.  She will have 90 - 30 = 60 dollars left.  So she will have money left over to invite friends.

[EXP] 83: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 37, [output]:  Let's break down the problem step by step. 

The food truck spends $3. 00 on bread for each loaf that makes 10 sandwiches.  To make 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread, so the bread cost is $3. 00. 

They spend $30. 00 on different cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches. 

They sell each sandwich for $7. 00, and they are selling 10 sandwiches. 

First, let's calculate the total revenue:
Total revenue = Number of sandwiches sold x Price per sandwich = 10 x $7. 00 = $70. 00

Now, let's calculate the cost:
Cost of bread = $3. 00 per loaf x 1 loaf = $3. 00
Cost of cheese and condiments = $30. 00 per 10 sandwiches

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments = $3. 00 + $30. 00 = $33. 00

Now, let's calculate the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $70. 00 - $33. 00 = $37. 00

The food truck's net profit is $37. 00.

The first house will need 1/2 of what the second house needs.  Let's call the amount of shingles needed for the second house "x".  Then, the first house will need x/2. 

The third house needs double what the first house needs.  So, the third house needs 2(x/2) = x. 

The three houses together need 250 cases of shingles, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x/2) + x = 250

Combine like terms:

5x/2 = 250

Multiply both sides by 2:

5x = 500

x = 100

Now we know what the second house needs: 100 cases of shingles.  To find out what the first house needs, multiply by 1/2:

Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so it costs 2 * 2 = 4 dollars.  6 packets of chicken will be 6 * 4 = 24 dollars.  The total cost of the bacon and chicken is 10 + 24 = 34 dollars.  2.  Next, we calculate the cost of the strawberries and apples.  The 3 packs of strawberries will be 3 * 4 = 12 dollars.  The 7 packs of apples each cost half of a strawberry pack, so each costs 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.  7 packs of apples will be 7 * 2 = 14 dollars.  The total cost of the strawberries and apples is 12 + 14 = 26 dollars.  3.  We now have the total cost of all the items, which is 34 + 26 = 60 dollars.  To find the amount of money left in Kelly’s budget, we subtract this total cost from her budget.  65 - 60 = 5.  The answer is 5 dollars. ']

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

The problem states that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.  So Peter's age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10. 

The problem also states that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old.  We can set up an equation using the ages:

Peter + Paul + John = 100

Substituting the expressions we found earlier, we get:

2x + 10 + x + x + 10 = 100

Combine like terms:

4x + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4x = 80

Divide by 4:

x = 20

So John's age is 20, and Paul's age is x + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30. 

Finally, we can find Peter's age, which is the sum of Paul and John's age:

Peter's age = 20 + 30 = 50

James has to swim 20 miles in total.  He swims 60% of the distance, which is 0. 6 x 20 = 12 miles.  To find the time he takes to swim these 12 miles, we divide the distance by his pace:

12 miles / 2 miles/hour = 6 hours

After swimming, James rests for half the time he spent swimming, which is 6/2 = 3 hours. 

He then starts swimming the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.  Since he's going at half his original pace, his new pace is:

2 miles/hour / 2 = 1 mile/hour

To find the time he takes to swim the remaining 8 miles, we divide the distance by his new pace:

8 miles / 1 mile/hour = 8 hours

Adding up the total time, we get:

6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming) = 17 hours

However, 4 people said they couldn't come, so the total number of people attending the party is 45 - 4 = 41. 

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest.  Since the party will have 41 guests, the additional guests are 41 - 20 = 21.  So the additional cost will be 21 x $6 = $126.  Therefore, the total cost of the party will be $125 (the initial fee) + $126 (the additional cost) = $251.

The velociraptors then ate half of what was left, which is 1/4/2 = 1/8 of the original.  Finally, the Allosaurus ate the remaining 1/8, leaving no triceratops left. 

Let x be the number of kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.  The T-Rex ate half of that, so the remaining amount is x / 2.  The velociraptors ate half of what was left, so the remaining amount is (x / 2) / 2 = x / 4.  The Allosaurus ate the remaining amount, which is x / 8. 

The amount eaten by the Allosaurus is given as 270 kg.  So, we set up an equation:

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 8:

x = 270 x 8
x = 2160

The triceratops had 2160 kg of meat before the T-Rex ate.

[EXP] 185: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 34, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step!

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, which is a total of 30 minutes per day.  She repeats this for 5 days a week. 

So, in a week, she meditates for 30 minutes * 5 days = 150 minutes. 

Additionally, she practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) for 5 days a week.  So, in total she practices yoga for 60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes per week. 

In a week, Charisma spends 150 minutes on meditation + 300 minutes on yoga = 450 minutes per week. 

Now, let's multiply this by the number of weeks.  In 4 weeks, she spends:

450 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1800 minutes

So, in 4 weeks, Charisma has spent a total of 1800 minutes on meditation and yoga practice.
