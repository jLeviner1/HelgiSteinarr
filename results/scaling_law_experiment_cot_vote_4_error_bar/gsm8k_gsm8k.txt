Since his second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip, he still needs to travel 60 - 20 - 15 = 25 miles after the first stop.  The distance between the two stops is the distance traveled after the first stop, which is 25 miles.  The answer is 25. 
 Let's start by understanding the situation.  Henry made two stops during his 60-mile bike trip.  The first stop was after 20 miles, and the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. 

To find the distance between the first and second stops, we need to find the distance from his first stop (20 miles) to his second stop (which is 15 miles before the end of the trip). 

The end of the trip is at 60 miles, so the second stop is at 60 - 15 = 45 miles. 

The distance between the first and second stops is the difference between the distances from the starting point (0 miles) to these two stops:

Distance to first stop = 20 miles
Distance to second stop = 45 miles

To find the distance between the stops, subtract the distance to the first stop from the distance to the second stop:

45 - 20 = 25 miles

[EXP] 18: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 95200, [output]: 4 years ago, Adrien's salary was 40000.  30% more than Lylah's means that his salary was 1. 3 times Lylah's.  So let's call Lylah's salary "x".  Then 1. 3x = 40000, or x = 40000/1. 3 = 30769.  So Lylah's salary was 30769.  Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, which is 40% of 40000, or 0. 4 x 40000 = 16000.  So his new salary is 40000 + 16000 = 56000.  Similarly, Lylah's salary increased by 40% of her old salary, or 0. 4 x 30769 = 12308.  So her new salary is 30769 + 12308 = 43077.  The total salary four years later is 56000 + 43077 = 99077. 
 Let's break this down step by step. 

Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.  This means that if Adrien made $100, Lylah made $70.  Since Adrien's salary was $40000 four years ago, Lylah's salary was $40000 x (70/100) = $28000. 

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so he is now earning 140% of his old salary.  40% of $40000 is $16000, so he is now earning $40000 + $16000 = $56000. 

Since Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%.  Her new salary is 140% of her old salary, which is $40000 x 1. 4 = $56000. 

The total salary the two are receiving four years later is the sum of their salaries, which is $56000 + $56000 = $112000. 

The answer is $112000. 
4 years ago, Adrien's salary was $40,000.  Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.  This means his new salary was 140% (or 100% + 40%) of his previous salary, which equals 1. 4 × 40,000 = 56,000. 

Lylah's salary was 30% lower than Adrien's, meaning 70% of Adrien's (40,000).  So, 70% of 40,000 is 56,000 × 0. 7 = 28,000. 

So, Adrien's salary was $56,000 and Lylah's salary was $28,000, four years later.  The total salary of both is $56,000 + $28,000 = $84,000. 
4 years ago, Adrien's salary was $40000.  Lylah's salary was 30% less than Adrien's, so Lylah was earning 40000 * (1 - 30%) = 40000 * (1 - 0. 3) = 40000 * 0. 7 = $28000.  Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so Adrien's salary is now 40000 * (1 + 0. 4) = 40000 * 1. 4 = 56000. 

Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, so their new salaries are $28000 + some percent.  Let this amount be x.  Since their salaries increased simultaneously, the amount that Adrien's salary increased (40%) should be the same as the percentage of their new salaries.  

So (Adrien's new salary - Adrien's old salary) / Adrien's old salary = (Lylah's new salary - Lylah's old salary) / Lylah's old salary. 
Dividing both sides by Adrien's old salary, (Adrien's new salary - 40000) / 40000 = (Lylah's new salary - 28000) / 28000.  Simplifying, 0. 4x / 40000 = (x - 28000) / 28000. 
Simplifying more, 0. 4x / 40000 = x / 28000 - 1.  Multiply both sides by 28000: 0. 4x = x - 56000. 

Subtracting x from both sides, 0. 4x - x = -56000 => -0. 6x = -56000.  Dividing both sides by -0. 6, x = 56000 / 0. 6 = 93333. 33. 

So the amount Lylah's salary increased is 93333. 33 - 28000 = 65333. 33.  So Lylah's new salary is 28000 + 65333. 33 = 96133. 33.  Adding Adrien's new salary and Lylah's new salary, their total salary is $93000. 
 Voted result: 4 years ago, Adrien's salary was 40000.  30% more than Lylah's means that his salary was 1. 3 times Lylah's.  So let's call Lylah's salary "x".

Let Jan's current age be X.  Given that Jan is 30 years old, X = 30. 

Two years ago, Jan's age would have been X - 2 = 28. 

Now we know that Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age two years ago.  So Mark's age two years ago was (28 / 2) + 5 = 19. 

Today, Mark's age is 19 + 2 = 21. 

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so 180 stitches.  900 + 90 + 180 = 1170.  The remaining 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches must be divided between the two sleeves.  630/2 = 315.  The answer is 315. 
1800 is the total number of stitches.  The body of the sweater requires 900 stitches.  The collar requires 1/10 of 900 stitches, which is 90 stitches.  The rosette requires twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 x 90 = 180 stitches.  So, in total, the body, collar, and rosette require 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.  Since there are 1800 stitches in total, the two sleeves must take up the remaining 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.  So, each sleeve requires 630 divided by 2, which is 315.  The answer is 315. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 

The whole project has 1800 stitches.  The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, so we know:

1800 - 900 = X, where X is the remaining stitches for the collar, sleeves, and rosette. 

X = 900

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so:

X/10 = 90

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:

90 x 2 = 180

Now, let's add up the stitches for the collar and rosette:

90 + 180 = 270

So the total stitches for the collar and rosette are 270.  This means:

900 (body) + 270 (collar and rosette) = 1170

We subtract 1170 from the total project stitches to find the remaining stitches for the sleeves:

1800 - 1170 = 630

Now, divide the remaining stitches by 2 (since there are 2 sleeves):

The answer is 360. 
150 teachers are there.  Out of them 60% are history teachers.  We need to find out how many history teachers there are.  You can use the percentage to get percentage parts:

60% = 6 / 10 = 3 / 5 = 0. 6

We multiply the total teachers by this number to get the number of history teachers:

150 * 0. 6 = 90

So there are 90 history teachers and the rest (150 - 90 = 60) are math teachers.  Now we know that there are 60 math teachers.

The answer is 6. 
54 students are to be separated into 6 groups.  If we divide 54 by 6, we get 9 students per group.  If there are 12 groups needed, then 6 more groups are required.  Since each group requires an additional 9 students, 6 * 9 = 54 more students are needed.  The answer is 6.

[EXP] 109: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]: 33 people on the council voted, so the total number of votes cast is 33.  If there were twice as many votes in favor as against, then the number of votes against is x.  The number of votes in favor is 2x. 

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and against: 2x + x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

So the number of votes against the regulation is 11.  The number of votes in favor is twice that: 2x = 2(11) = 22

The answer is 22. 
33 people were in the council.  It is known that 1/3 of them voted against, so 1/3 x 33 = 11 people.  Then, twice as many voted for the new regulation.  So, 2 * 11 = 22 voted in favor.  The answer is 22. 
 Let's start by assuming there were x votes against the new regulation.  Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation was twice that of the votes against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x. 

There are 33 people on the council, and each person's vote counts as one.  So, the total number of votes is equal to 33.  We can set up an equation based on this:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide by 3:

x = 11

So, there were 11 votes against the new regulation.  Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation was twice that of the votes against, the number of votes in favor is:

2x = 2(11) = 22

The answer is 22. 
33 people are on the council.  In total there are votes in favor and against.  The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against.  So, let's call the number of votes against x.  Then the number of votes in favor is 2x. 

The total votes in favor and against is the total number of people on the council, which is 33. 

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

From Monday to Friday, his car travelled 10 miles x 5 days = 50 miles.  

Andy's car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, so 50 miles would require 50/10 = 5 gallons of gas.  

At $3 per gallon, the car would consume 5 x $3 = $15 per week.  The answer is 15. 
 Let's break it down step by step.  

Andy's car uses 1 gallon of fuel for every 10 miles.  Since he goes to work each day, Monday to Friday, that's 5 miles one way, so 10 miles round trip.  Since he does this for 5 days, he will use 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles for the week.  

To find out how many gallons of fuel he used, we can divide the distance (50 miles) by his car's fuel efficiency (10 MPG).  50/10 = 5 gallons of fuel.

She has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. 
She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has 9 ÷ 3 = 3 yellow eggs. 

To find the total number of eggs, add them up:

Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.  So Naruto can lift a mountain (10 * 4 * 12) times higher than Pompei.  Since Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Naruto can lift a mountain (10 * 4 * 12 * 1) inches.  10 * 4 * 12 * 1 is 480.  There are 12 inches in a foot, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet.  The answer is 40.

2.  Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, so Peter's age = Paul's age + Jean's age. 
3.  The sum of Peter, Paul and Jean's age is 100, so we can set up the equation:

4.  Substitute the expressions for Paul's age and Peter's age from (1) and (2) into the equation:
   (Paul's age + Jean's age) + Paul's age + Jean's age = 100
   2(Paul's age) + 2(Jean's age) = 100
   Paul's age + Jean's age = 50

1.  Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes. 
2.  Baking the cake takes 30 minutes. 
3.  The cake needs 2 hours to cool. 
4.  Frosting requires 10 minutes. 

So, in total, it takes 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes to make the cake. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total time to hours:
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, she needs to finish making it at 5:00 pm.  To find the earliest time she can start making the cake, we subtract the total time it takes to make the cake from the serving time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan should start making the cake at 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.  The answer is 2:00 pm.

The total time is:
20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60:
180 ÷ 60 = 3 hours

Add 3 hours to the initial starting time.  Since the cake needs to be served at 5:00 pm, Jordan must start making the cake by:

[EXP] 157: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1080, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

Initially, the T-Rex ate half of the small triceratops.  Let's call the initial weight of the triceratops "x" kilograms. 

After the T-Rex ate half, the remaining weight is x/2. 

The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, which means they ate x/4 (since x/2 is now being halved again). 

The remaining weight after the velociraptors ate is x/4. 

The Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms, which is the remaining weight. 

So, we can set up the equation: x/4 = 270

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4: x = 270 * 4

x = 1080

So, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest waterslide:

Time to ride the second biggest slide = Distance / Speed
= 240 feet / (80 feet/minute)
= 240 feet / 80

Now, let's find the difference in time:

We know the average car can go 120 mph. 
The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so:
2nd fastest car speed = 120 mph × 5 = 600 mph

The fastest car is 1. 25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so:
Fastest car speed = 2nd fastest car speed × 1. 25
= 600 mph × 1. 25
= 750 mph

So, the fastest car can go 750 mph!

The answer is 750. 
1st step: Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.  Since it's 5 times faster than the average car, which is 120 miles per hour, it will be 5 x 120 = 600 miles per hour. 

2nd step: Determine the speed of the fastest car.  The problem says that it's 1. 25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.  The 2nd fastest car is 600 miles per hour.  So the fastest car is 1. 25 x 600 = 750 miles per hour. 

The answer is 750. 
 Let's start by understanding the given information. 

* The 2nd fastest car is 5 times the speed of the average car. 
* The average car's speed is 120 mph. 
* The fastest car is 1. 25 times the speed of the 2nd fastest car. 

Let's find the speed of the 2nd fastest car.  Since it's 5 times the average speed, we multiply 120 mph by 5:

120 mph * 5 = 600 mph

Now we know the 2nd fastest car can go 600 mph. 

Since the fastest car is 1. 25 times the speed of the 2nd fastest car, we multiply 600 mph by 1. 25:

 Ronnie was given 5 dollars.  Rissa was given thrice as much, so Rissa was given 5 * 3 = 15 dollars. 

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's say they each gave x dollars. 

Rissa's money left after giving is 4/5 of her original amount, which is 15 dollars.  15 - x = (4/5) * 15.  Solve for x:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15
15 - x = 12
x = 3

Since twice as many bottles of cognac are bought, that means 20 bottles of cognac are bought.  Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than each bottle of scotch, so each bottle of cognac costs 60 * 1. 5 = $90.  The total cost of cognac is 20 * 90 = $1800.  In total, John spends $600 + $1800 = $2400.  The answer is 2400. 
 John bought 10 bottles of scotch for 600 dollars.  To find the cost of each bottle of scotch, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: 600 ÷ 10 = 60 dollars per bottle. 

Then he bought twice as many bottles of cognac, so that's 2 x 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.  The cost of each bottle of cognac is 50% more than 60 dollars, so 1. 5 x 60 = 90 dollars per bottle of cognac.  The total cost of cognac is 20 x 90 = 1800 dollars.

There are 8 hours in a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour.  So the total number of minutes in a day is 8 * 60 = 480.  

The custodian has 5 days to finish.  So the total time they have is 5 * 480 = 2400 minutes.  To get the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, you have to divide the 1200 minutes it takes to clean classrooms by the total minutes in a day, 2400. 

1200 / 2400 = 0. 5.  Multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

So, on average, the custodian spends 50 percent of their time cleaning classrooms.  The answer is 50.

[EXP] 185: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 34, [output]:  Let's first calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation each day. 

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes before sleep, which is a total of 15 + 15 = 30 minutes per day. 

Now, let's calculate the total time she spends on yoga practice each day:

Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour, which is 60 minutes per day. 

Now, let's calculate the total time she spends on meditation and yoga practice each day:

30 minutes (meditation) + 60 minutes (yoga) = 90 minutes per day

Since she does this 5 days a week, the total time she spends on meditation and yoga practice per week is:

90 minutes/day × 5 days/week = 450 minutes per week

Now, let's calculate the total time she spends on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks:

450 minutes/week × 4 weeks = 1800 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to hours:

1800 minutes ÷ 60 = 30 hours

The answer is 30 hours. 
 It would be easier to calculate the time spent each week first, then add it up. 

Charisma meditates twice a day, for 15 minutes each.  That is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes a day.  In 5 days, she meditates 30 * 5 = 150 minutes.  This is equivalent to 2. 5 hours. 

She also practices yoga for 1 hour each day, 5 days a week.  That is 1 * 5 = 5 hours a week. 

A week is 7 days, so in 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation/yoga practice is 4 * (2. 5 + 5) hours.  That is 4 * 7. 5 = 30 hours.
