[EXP] 3: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]: 20% of 20 is 20 * 0. 2 = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  After that, there are 20 - 4 = 16 students remaining.  25% of 16 is 16 * 0. 25 = 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.  After that, there are 16 - 4 = 12 students remaining.  So the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 12/20 = 0. 6 = 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
20% of the students, 20/100 * 20 = 4 students, enrolled in contemporary dance.  This leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students remaining.

The rest, 12 students, enrolled in hip-hop dance. 

To find the percentage, divide 12 by 20 and multiply by 100: (12/20) * 100 = 60%.  

The answer is 60%. 
20% of 20 students is 20% * 20 = 4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance.  That leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students.  25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0. 25 * 16 = 4 students.  That leaves 16 - 4 = 12 students.  So 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.  This is a percentage of the entire class, which is 12/20 = 0. 6 or 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 20 * 0. 20 = 4 students.  25% of the remaining students (20 - 4 = 16) enrolled in jazz dance, so that is 0. 25 * 16 = 4 students.  The remaining students, 12, enrolled in hip-hop dance.  The percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 12/20 = 0. 6 = 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 20% * 20 = 4 students.  
There are now 20 - 4 = 16 students remaining.  
25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25% * 16 = 4 students.  
There are now 16 - 4 = 12 students remaining.  
The rest enrolled in hip-hop dance.  So, 12 out of 20 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.  
To convert this to a percentage, divide by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%. 
The answer is 60%. 
20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance.  20% of 20 students is 20% x 20 = 4 students.  Then 16 students are left.  25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance.  25% of 16 students is 25% x 16 = 4 students.  So 12 students are left.  The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance.  12 students for 20 students in total means 12/20 or 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
20% of 20 students is 20 * 0. 20 = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  That leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students remaining.  Of those 16, 25% enrolled in jazz dance.  16 * 0. 25 = 4 students.  That leaves 16 - 4 = 12 students remaining.  12 is the number of students that enrolled in hip-hop dance.  To get the percentage, we divide 12 by 20 (the total students) and multiply by 100: (12/20) * 100 = 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
20 students were originally in the dance class.  20% of 20 is 0. 20 * 20 = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  That leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students remaining.  25% of the remaining students, or 0. 25 * 16 = 4 students, enrolled in jazz dance.  That leaves 16 - 4 = 12 students remaining.  To find the percentage of students that enrolled in hip-hop dance, divide 12 by the original 20, then multiply by 100:

(12 / 20) * 100 = 60

The answer is 60. 
20% of 20 is 20/100 * 20 = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  
This leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students.  
25% of the remaining 16 students is 25/100 * 16 = 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.  
This leaves 16 - 4 = 12 students.  
So 12 students are left for hip-hop dance.  

The percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is 12/20 = 12/20 * 100 = 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance.  This means 20% of 20, which is 20 x 0. 2 = 4.  After 4 enrolled in contemporary dance, 20 - 4 = 16 students remained.  25% of these 16 students enrolled in jazz dance.  25% of 16 is 16 x 0. 25 = 4.  After 4 enrolled in jazz dance, 16 - 4 = 12 students remained.  So 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance, out of the original 20 students.  12 / 20 = 0. 6 or 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
20% of 20 students is 20% x 20 = 4 students.  20% of the remaining means 20 students - 4 students = 16 students are left.  25% of 16 students is 25% x 16 = 4 students.  So 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.  The rest enrolled in hip-hop dance.  20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.  So 12 out of 20 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.  The percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is (12/20) x 100% = 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
20% enrolled in contemporary dance, which means 20% of 20 students or 20 * 20% = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  That leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students.  25% of 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, which means 16 * 25% = 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.  That leaves 16 - 4 = 12 students.  The rest, 12 students, enrolled in hip-hop dance. 

The question asks for the percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance.  Since 12 out of 20 students enrolled in hip-hop dance, the percentage is 12/20 = 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, so that is 20% * 20 = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  That leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students remaining. 

25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance.  Since 25% of 16 is 4, 4 more students enrolled in jazz dance.  That leaves 16 - 4 = 12 students remaining. 

To find the percentage of students that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can divide the number of students in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100. 

The number of students in hip-hop dance is 12, and the total number of students is 20.  So, the percentage of students in hip-hop dance is:

(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The answer is 60%. 
20% of 20 students are 20 * 0. 2 = 4 students.  Then 20 - 4 = 16 students are left.  25% of 16 are 16 * 0. 25 = 4 students.  16 - 4 = 12 students are left.  There are still 12 students left, and that is 12/20 = 0. 6, which is 60%.  So 60% of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance.  The answer is 60. 
20% of 20 students is 20% x 20 = 4 students.  So 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  The remaining students will be 20 - 4 = 16.  25% of 16 is 25% x 16 = 4.  So 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.  If 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance and 4 students enrolled in jazz dance, the remaining students will be 20 - 4 - 4 = 12.  Since there are 20 students in total, 12 students must have enrolled in hip-hop dance.  We need to find the percentage of 12 students in the total 20 students.  12/20 is 0. 6, which is 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance, so that's (0. 2 * 20) = 4 students.  That leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students remaining.  25% of those enrolled in jazz dance, so that's (0. 25 * 16) = 4 students.  The remaining students are the ones that didn't go to contemporary or jazz dance, so that's 16 - 4 = 12 students.  This is 12/20 or 0. 6 of the total students, which is equivalent to 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
20% enrolled in contemporary dance, which means 20/100 = 0. 2 x 20 = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  So 20 - 4 = 16 students are left. 
From the remaining students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance, which means 25/100 = 0. 25 x 16 = 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.  So 16 - 4 = 12 students are left for hip-hop dance. 
In total, 20 students were enrolled and 4 went to contemporary, 4 went to jazz, and 12 went to hip-hop.  So the percentage of students who went to hip-hop dance is 12/20 = 0. 6.  As a percentage, this is 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance.  To find this, multiply 20% by 20 to get 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16.  25% of 16 is 16 x 0. 25 = 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.  Then, there are 16 - 4 = 12 students remaining and these students will enroll in hip-hop dance.  In other words, 12 / 20 = 0. 6 or 60%.  The answer is 60. 
20% of 20 is 20 x 0. 2 = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  That means the remaining 20 - 4 = 16 students enrolled in either jazz or hip-hop dance.  25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance.  16 x 0. 25 = 4 students enrolled in jazz.  So the remaining students enrolled in hip-hop dance will be 16 - 4 = 12.  To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, divide 12 by the total students (20) and multiply with 100: (12/20) x 100 = 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
20 students are in the class.  20% of 20 is 4.  So 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  That leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students left.  25% of 16 is 4.  So 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.  That leaves 16 - 4 = 12 students left.  The rest enrolled in hip-hop dance.  So, 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance, and 20 students enrolled in the class in total.  Since 12 students out of 20 are in hip-hop dance, the answer is 60% in hip-hop dance. 
20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, so 0. 2 * 20 = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  The remaining students after 4 students finished with contemporary dance is 20 - 4 = 16 students.  25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0. 25 * 16 = 4 students.  The number of students enrolled in jazz dance is 4 students.  Therefore, the number of students left for hip-hop dance is 20 - (4 + 4) = 12 students.  The students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 12 students out of 20 students.  12 / 20 = 0. 6.  As a percentage, it is 60%.  The answer is 60. 
20% of the class enrolled in contemporary dance.  This means 20% of 20 is 20 x 0. 2 = 4 students.  After 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance, 20 - 4 = 16 students are left.  Then, 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance.  25% of 16 is 16 x 0. 25 = 4 students.  So 4 more students enrolled in jazz dance.  Now, we subtract the students who enrolled in jazz dance and contemporary dance from the total students, and we are left with 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.  These remaining 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.  The question asks what percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance.  Since 12 out of 20 students enrolled in hip-hop dance, the percentage can be found by dividing 12 by 20, then multiplying by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 0. 6 * 100 = 60.  The answer is 60%. 
20% of the students in the dance class learned contemporary dance.  This means 20% of 20 students is:

20% * 20 = 0. 20 * 20 = 4 students

4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students. 

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance.  25% of 16 students is:

25% * 16 = 0. 25 * 16 = 4 students

The 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.  

The rest of the students, which is 16 - 4 = 12 students, enrolled in hip-hop dance. 

The question asks what percent of the entire 20 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.  Out of the total 20 students, 12 enrolled in hip-hop dance.  To find the percentage, we divide 12 by 20:

12 / 20 = 0. 6

As a percentage, it is 0. 6 * 100 = 60%. 

The answer is 60%.

[EXP] 4: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Samantha is 31 now, but Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.  So Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.  Raymond was 23 when his son was born.  So his son was born 25 - 23 = 2 years ago.  The answer is 2. 
31 - 6 = 25 is Samantha's age when Raymond had a son.  23 + 2 = 25 is the age Raymond was when he had a son.  So Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.  The answer is 2. 
 Samantha is currently 31 years old.  Raymond was born 6 years before her, so Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.  When Raymond had a son at the age of 23, the son was born 25 - 23 = 2 years ago.  The answer is 2. 
31 - 6 is 25.  Since Raymond was 23 years old when he had his son, 25 - 23 = 2 years ago.  The answer is 2. 
 Samantha is 31 years old, so Raymond was 31 - 6 = 25 when Samantha was born.  If Raymond had his son at age 23, then his son was born 25 - 23 = 2 years after Raymond's age when Samantha was born.  The answer is 2. 
 Samantha is currently 31 years old, which means she was born 31 years ago.  Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so he was born 31 - 6 = 25 years ago.  When Raymond had his son at the age of 23, his son would be born 25 - 23 = 2 years ago.  The answer is 2. 
 Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.  So Samantha is 6 years older than Raymond.  Samantha is now 31, so Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25.  Raymond had his son at the age of 23, so we subtract 23 from 25 to get the number of years ago.  25 - 23 is 2.  The answer is 2. 
 Samantha is 31 now and was born 6 years after Raymond.  So she was 6 years younger than Raymond.  If she is 31, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25.  Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so that was 25 - 23 = 2 years ago.  The answer is 2. 
 We can determine Raymond's age by seeing how old Samantha is (31) and then subtracting Samantha's age - 6, since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.  So Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.  Raymond had his son 25 - 23 = 2 years after he turned 23.  The answer is 2. 
1.  find Samantha's birth year: Samantha is 31 now.  Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, he is 31 - 6 = 25 now. 

2.  Calculate Raymond's age when his son was born: Raymond is now 25, but was 23 when his son was born.  So Raymond's son was born 2 years ago. 

The answer is 2. 
 Raymond's age is unknown.  
To find Raymond's age now, we have to recall that Samantha is now 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.  So Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.  
When Raymond was 23, Samantha must have been 6 years old.  31 - 6 = 25, 23 + 6 = 29.  Since Samantha is now 31, Raymond's son must have been born 2 years ago.  The answer is 2.

 The total distance is 60 miles.  He stopped after 20 miles, so 60 - 20 = 40 miles left.  His second stop was 15 miles before the end, so it is 40 - 15 = 25 miles from the 20-mile stop to the second stop.  The answer is 25. 
20 miles is the distance between the start and the first stop.  So Henry has 60 - 20 = 40 miles left to complete his trip.  His second stop is 15 miles before the end, so he must have traveled 40 - 15 = 25 miles between his first and second stops.  The answer is 25. 
60 miles total, with a 20-mile initial stop.  This means the remaining distance before the second stop is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.  Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance between the stops is 40 - 15 = 25 miles.  The answer is 25. 
 Let's break this down.  We know Henry stopped after 20 miles.  His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so he must have gone 60 - 15 = 45 miles after the first stop.  Therefore, from his first stop to his second stop, he traveled 45 - 20 = 25 miles.  The answer is 25. 
 Henry went 20 miles for his first stop.  Since he stopped 15 miles before the end of the trip, we can find the end of the trip by subtracting 15 from 60.  60 - 15 is 45.  So the end of the trip is 45 miles.  The distance between the first and second stops is the difference between the distance to the second stop (45) and the distance to the first stop (20).  45 - 20 is 25.  The answer is 25. 
 The trip was 60 miles long.  The first stop was 20 miles, so he traveled 20 miles at that point.  If his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, that means the trip was 60 - 15 = 45 miles from the second stop to the end.  So he traveled 45 - 20 = 25 miles between the stops.  The answer is 25. 
 Henry started his trip from 0 miles.  After his first stop, he went 20 miles.  His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, which means he had 60 - 15 = 45 miles left.  So, he traveled 20 to his first stop and then from his first stop to his second, which is 45 - 20 = 25 miles.  The answer is 25. 
 Let's break this down step by step. 

Henry stopped after 20 miles, which means he had gone 20 miles by that point.  Since he had 60 miles total, that means he had 60 - 20 = 40 miles left to go after his first stop. 

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, which means he had 40 - 15 = 25 miles left to go to the end of the trip. 

The distance between his first and second stops is the distance he traveled between those two stops, which is 25 miles. 

The answer is 25. 
 The trip starts with 60 miles total.  The first stop is after 20 miles, and the second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip.  Since Henry stopped after 20 miles, that means the second stop is 60 - 20 = 40 miles after the first stop.  So the distance between the first and second stops is 40 - 15 = 25 miles, because 15 miles is the distance to the end of the trip from the second stop.  The answer is 25. 
 Henry started with 0 miles and stopped after 20 miles, so the distance he traveled before the first stop is 20 miles.  At that point, 40 miles remained for him to travel, as the total trip is 60 miles.  He stopped 15 miles before the end, so the distance he traveled after the first stop to reach the second stop is 40 - 15 = 25 miles.  The answer is 25. 
15 is the distance that Henry didn't ride between his first and second stops, from the end of the trip.  Since his second stop was 15 miles from the end, he would have been at the end after traveling 60 - 15 = 45 miles.  He rode 20 miles before his first stop, so he rode 45 - 20 = 25 miles between his first and second stops.  The answer is 25. 
60 miles was the total distance conquered.  20 miles was for the first stop.  So he originally had 60 - 20 miles left, which is 40 miles.  He stopped for the second time 15 miles before the end of the trip.  If he traveled 15 miles after that, he must have arrived at the end.  Before that he must have gone 40 - 15 = 25 miles.  The answer is 25. 
60 is the total distance.  So far, Henry has traveled 20 miles to his first stop.  His second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip.  So the remaining distance from the first stop is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.  His second stop is 15 miles before the end, so we subtract 15 from 40 to get 25.  20 (distance to first stop) + 25 (distance between stops) is 45.  Henry stopped after 20 miles, then had a break, after which he had 40 miles left.  While in that break, he rode 25 miles, so that's the distance between his first and second stops.  The answer is 25. 
andalone almost got hurt trying to solve this problem hah.  There are 60 miles in total.  He stopped after 20 miles.  So 20 miles rode.  But he didn't stop at the end, he stopped 15 miles before the end.  So the second stop must have been at 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

[EXP] 8: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]: 15 floors x 8 units per floor = 120 total units.  Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, that means 1/4 of the building is unoccupied.  1/4 of 120 is 30.  The answer is 30. 
15 floors times 8 units per floor is 15 x 8 = 120 units.  If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then 1/4 is unoccupied.  1/4 of 120 is 30.  The answer is 30. 
15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 total units.  3/4 of the building is occupied.  So 1/4 of the building is unoccupied.  120 * 1/4 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
 Richard lives in an apartment building with 15 floors.  Each floor contains 8 units, so in total there are 8 * 15 = 120 units.  3/4 of the building is occupied, which means 1/4 of the building is unoccupied.  1/4 of 120 is 30.  The answer is 30. 
15 floors, each with 8 units, means there are 15 x 8 = 120 units in total.  3/4 of the building is occupied, so the number of occupied units is 120 * 3/4 = 90.  The total number of unoccupied units is 120 - 90 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
 Let's start by finding the total number of units in the building.  There are 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units, so the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120.  Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, that means 1/4 of the building is unoccupied.  1/4 * 120 = 30 units are unoccupied.  The answer is 30. 
 There are 15 floors with 8 units per floor.  So there are 15 * 8 = 120 total units.  3/4 of the building is occupied.  So 1/4 of the building is unoccupied.  120 * 1/4 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 total units in the building.  3/4 * 120 = 90 occupied units.  To find the unoccupied units, we subtract 90 from the total: 120 - 90 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
15 floors with 8 units each means there are 15 * 8 = 120 units total.  Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 120 * (3/4) = 90.  To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total units.  120 - 90 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
 First, calculate the total number of units in the building.  15 floors * 8 units per floor is 15 * 8 = 120 units.  If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then 1/4 of the building is unoccupied.  1/4 of 120 is 120 / 4 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
 There are 15 floors in the building.  Each floor has 8 units, so there are a total of 15 * 8 = 120 units in the building. 

The building is 3/4 occupied, so the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90. 

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30. 

The answer is 30. 
15 floors, each with 8 units, means there are 15 * 8 = 120 units.  But since 3/4 of the building is occupied, then 1/4 of the building is unoccupied.  1/4 * 120 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
8 units per floor means there are a total of 8 x 15 = 120 units in the building.  3/4 of the building is occupied.  So, 3/4 of 120 units are occupied.  3/4 of 120 is 90.  The unoccupied units are 120 - 90 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
 Richard lives in an apartment building with 15 floors.  Each floor contains 8 units.  To find the total number of units, we multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor: 15 * 8 = 120.  3/4 of the building is occupied.  So, 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 of the building is unoccupied.  Since 1/4 of the total is unoccupied, we can multiply the total by 1/4 to find the number of unoccupied units: 120 * 1/4 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
 Let's find the total number of units first.  There are 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units.  So, the total number of units = 15 x 8 = 120 units.  The building is 3/4 occupied, which means 1/4 of the building is unoccupied.  To find the number of unoccupied units, we multiply the total number of units by the fraction unoccupied: 120 x (1/4) = 120/4 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
 Richard's apartment building has 15 floors, each containing 8 units.   That means there are 15 x 8 = 120 total units.  If 3/4 of the building is occupied, that means the occupied units are 3/4 x 120 = 90 units.  So the unoccupied units are 120 - 90 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
15 floors in the building.  Each floor has 8 units.  So the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120.  3/4 of the building is occupied, which means the total number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90.  So there are 90 occupied units.  To find the unoccupied units, we subtract 90 from 120.  120 - 90 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
 Each floor has 8 units, and there are 15 floors.  So, the total number of units is 8 x 15 = 120.  If 3/4 of the building is occupied, that means that (3/4) * 120 units are occupied.  To find the number of occupied units, we can multiply the number of units by the fraction:

(3/4) * 120 = 90

So, 90 units are occupied.  To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total number of units:

120 - 90 = 30

There are 30 unoccupied units in the building.  The answer is 30. 
3/4 of the building is occupied.  So only 1/4 of the building is unoccupied.  
The building has 15 floors.  Each floor has 8 units.  So the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120.  
The unoccupied portion is 1/4 of the building, so it is 1/4 * 120 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
 To find the total number of units in the building, multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor: 15 x 8 = 120. 

Then, we need to find 1/4 of the total units, which means 3/4 of the total units are occupied.  So, the number of occupied units is 3/4 x 120 = 90. 

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30. 

The answer is 30. 
 First, let's find the total number of units in the building.  There are 15 floors, each with 8 units, so the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120. 

Next, we need to find the number of occupied units.  If 3/4 of the building is occupied, that means the number of occupied units is 3/4 of 120.  To find this, we can multiply 120 by 3 and divide by 4: (120 * 3) / 4 = 90. 

Now that we know the total number of units (120) and the number of occupied units (90), we can find the number of unoccupied units by subtracting the occupied units from the total: 120 - 90 = 30. 

The answer is 30. 
 Initially, there are a total of 15 floors.  Each contains 8 units, so in total there are 15 x 8 = 120 units.  If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then the occupied units are 3/4 x 120 = 90.  To find the unoccupied units, subtract the occupied units from the total number of units.  120 - 90 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
 We first calculate the number of occupied units.  To do this, we multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor to get the total number of units.  This is 15 x 8 = 120 units.  Then we multiply this number by 3/4 to get 90 occupied units.  The number of unoccupied units is the total number of units minus the number of occupied units.  120 - 90 = 30. 

The answer is 30. 
1) First, I'll find the total number of units.  There are 15 floors with 8 units each.  So, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120 units. 
2) I'll find the number of occupied units.  3/4 of the building is occupied.  That means (3/4) * 120 = 90 units are occupied. 
3) To get the number of unoccupied units, I'll subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.  120 - 90 = 30. 
The answer is 30. 
 We need to find the total number of units in the building, then subtract the number of occupied units to find the number of unoccupied units.  There are 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units.  So the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120. 

Then, if 3/4 of the building is occupied, it means that 3/4 of 120 units are occupied.  To find the number of occupied units, we multiply 120 by 3/4:

120 * 3/4 = 90

So, 90 units are occupied.  The total number of unoccupied units would be:

120 - 90 = 30

The answer is 30. 
 There are 15 floors in the building, and each floor has 8 units, so in total there are 15 x 8 = 120 units.  Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, that means 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 of the building is unoccupied.  If we represent the building as a fraction, 1/4 is the unoccupied part.  We need to find what 1/4 of 120 is.  Since 1/4 is the same as 25%, we are looking for 25% of 120.  25% of 120 is 30.  So the answer is 30.

In total, she paid 840 + 756 = 1596.  The answer is 1596. 
140 dollars is the charge for one month.  For the first 6 months, she will be charged 6 x 140 = 840 dollars.  Then, for the remaining 6 months, she will be charged 10% less, which is 0. 9 x 140 = 126 dollars.  So she will be charged 6 x 126 = 756 dollars for the remaining 6 months.  In total, she will be charged 840 + 756 = 1596 dollars for the year.  The answer is 1596. 
140 dollars for the first half of the year is 140 * 6 = 840 dollars.  For the second half of the year, 10% less is 90% of 140, so 0. 9 * 140 = 126.  6 months with 126 dollars each will be 126 * 6 = 756.  The total amount paid for the year will be 840 + 756 = 1596.  The answer is 1596. 
140 is the initial charge per month.  For the first half of the year, she paid 140 x 6 = 840 dollars.  For the second half of the year, she paid 10% less than the initial charge.  10% of 140 is 14, so she paid 140 - 14 = 126 per month for the second half.  She paid 126 x 6 = 756 dollars for the second half of the year.  So the total she paid in a year is 840 + 756 = 1596.  The answer is 1596.

In total, she will pay 840 + 756 = 1596 dollars.  The answer is 1596. 
140 dollars per month for the first half of the year will be 140 x 6 = 840.  The second half of the year will be 10% less than 140 dollars.  10% of 140 is 0. 1 * 140 = 14.  So 140 - 14 = 126.  The 126 dollars for the second half of the year will be 126 x 6 = 756.  In total, Aleena paid 840 + 756 = 1596.  The answer is 1596. 
140 dollars a month, for 6 months that's 140 x 6 = 840 dollars.  On the remaining 6 months, she pays 10% less.  140 x 0. 1 = 14, so she pays 140 - 14 = 126 dollars.  126 x 6 = 756.  The total is 840 + 756 = 1596.  The answer is 1596. 
140 dollars per month is 140 x 12 = 1680 for the full year.  For the first half of the year, the charge is 140 x 6 = 840.  The second half is 10% less.  To find 10% of 840, we find 10/100 * 840 = 84.  So the charge for the second half is 840 - 84 = 756.  840 + 756 = 1596.  The answer is 1596. 
 Aleena is paying $140 per month.  Since the year is divided into half, she paid $140 for the first 6 months, and $140 * 0. 9 = $126 for the next 6 months (10% less than $140).  In total, she paid 6 x 140 + 6 x 126.  This is 840 + 756 = 1596.  The answer is 1596. 
 Aleena's monthly subscription is $140.  She is charged for 6 months at the full rate, which is 6 x 140 = 840.  

For the remaining 6 months, she pays 10% less.  10% of 140 is 14, so she pays 140 - 14 = 126 per month.  For 6 months, that's 126 x 6 = 756.  

Total cost is 840 + 756 = 1596.  The answer is 1596. 
 Since the streaming company charged Aleena for 6 months at the initial rate, that would be 140 * 6 = 840.  For the next 6 months, they charged her 10% less.  10% of 140 is 14, so the rate for the second half of the year was 140 - 14 = 126.  For the last 6 months, the amount she paid would be 126 * 6 = 756.  The total amount paid by the end of the year would be 840 + 756 = 1596.  The answer is 1596. 
140 is the initial charge per month, so half a year would be 140 x 6 = 840 dollars.  The other half of the year, she would pay 10% less, which is 140 x 0. 1 = 14 dollars, so she would pay 140 - 14 = 126 per month.  For the other 6 months, she would pay 126 x 6 = 756 dollars.  So in total she would have paid 840 + 756 = 1596 dollars.  The answer is 1596. 
140 dollars is charged for each month.  Since the year is divided into two halves, for the first 6 months, it will cost 6 x 140 = 840.  For the second half of the year, 10% less is charged.  So 840 * (1 - 0. 1) = 840 * 0. 9 = 756.  The total amount charged for the whole year is 840 + 756 = 1596.  The answer is 1596. 
120 days in a year, so 6 months as the first half and 6 months as the second half. 

First six months: Aleena pays 140 dollars for each month.  For 6 months, that's 6 x 140 = 840 dollars. 

Second six months: 10% less than 140 would be 0. 9 * 140 = 126 dollars.  For 6 months, that's 6 x 126 = 756 dollars. 

Total amount paid for the year is 840 + 756 = 1596.  The answer is 1596. 
140 dollars a month for 6 months (half a year) will be 6 x 140 = 840 dollars.  Now the company gives a 10% discount on 140 dollars, which is 0. 1 x 140 = 14 dollars.  So the discount is 14 dollars.  Then, the amount charged for the remaining 6 months is 140 - 14 = 126 dollars.  For the remaining 6 months, Aleena pays 126 dollars a month.  126 x 6 = 756.  756 + 840 = 1596.  The answer is 1596. 
140 dollars per month is the subscription.  Aleena has two periods of 6 months each (first half of the year, then the second half).  For the first half of the year, she pays 6 x 140 = 840 dollars.  For the second half of the year, there is 10% less, so 140 - 14 = 126 dollars per month.  Then she pays 126 x 6 = 756 dollars for the second half of the year.  The total she pays is 840 + 756 = 1596 dollars.  The answer is 1596. 
 Aleena has 140 dollars for the first half of the year.  Since the year has 12 months, the first half is 6 months.  In the second half, she has 6 months to pay.  To calculate the 10% decrease, we do 0. 1 * 140 = 14.  140 - 14 = 126.  For the first half, Aleena pays 140 * 6 = 840 dollars.  For the second half, she pays 126 * 6 = 756 dollars.  In total, Aleena paid 840 + 756 dollars.  This is 1596.  The answer is 1596. 
 The streaming company charged her the initial amount for the first half of the year.  The streaming company charged her $140 per month.  So in the first 6 months, she paid 140 x 6 = 840 dollars.  The company charged her 10% less on the second half of the year.  So the company charged 90% of $140 on the second half of the year.  90% of $140 is 0. 9 x 140 = 126.  The company charged her for 140 + 6 = 6 months.  So she paid 126 x 6 = 756 dollars.  The total amount she had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year was 840 + 756 = 1596 dollars.  The answer is 1596. 
 There are different values here.  So we can break it down into two problems. 

The first problem is that the company charged her for 6 months at 140 dollars.  So she paid 6 x 140 dollars = 840 dollars in the first half of the year. 

Then in the second half, the charge is 10% less.  So 140 * 0. 9 = 126.  For 6 months she has to pay 126 * 6 = 756 dollars. 

Then, the total is 840 + 756 = 1596.  The answer is 1596. 
1.  We need to first calculate the amount Aleena paid for the first half of the year.  If she paid 140 dollars per month, then she paid 140 dollars x 6 (for the 6 months of the half year) = 840 dollars for the first half year. 

2.  Then, we need to calculate the amount she paid on the second half of the year.  Aleena got a 10% discount.  To find the amount of the discount, we first need to find 10% of the original price: 10% = 0. 10.  We multiply 140 dollars by 0. 10 to get 14 dollars.  So Aleena gets a 14 dollar discount.  The price of the second half year is 140 - 14 = 126 dollars.  Since it's for half a year, she pays 126 dollars x 6 = 756 dollars for the second half year. 

3.  Now, we need to calculate the total amount Aleena paid.  We add the amount she paid for the first half year (840 dollars) and the amount she paid for the second half year (756 dollars): 840 + 756 = 1596. 

The answer is 1596.

 Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry. 

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, which means he does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry. 

The difference between Raymond's laundry and David's laundry is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.  The answer is 100. 
 Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.  David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.  Raymond does half as much as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.  Now to find the difference, we do 200 - 100 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
 Let's start by using the information that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.  If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, then David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry. 

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so he does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry. 

To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract 100 (David's laundry) from 200 (Raymond's laundry).  200 - 100 = 100. 

The answer is 100. 
 Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.  David does 1/4 as much laundry as Sarah.  So David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.

 Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, David does 400/4 = 100 pounds of laundry.  Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, Raymond does 400/2 = 200 pounds of laundry.  Now we can find the difference between Raymond's and David's laundry: 200 - 100 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 

Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.  Since David does 1/4 as much laundry as Sarah, David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry. 

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so he does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry. 

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do.  This is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds. 

The answer is 100. 
 Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.  Raymond does half as much, so he does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds.  David does 1/4th as much as Sarah, so he does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.  

The difference in the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.  The answer is 100. 
 Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, David does 400 ÷ 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.  Raymond does half as much as Sarah, which is 400 ÷ 2 = 200 pounds.  To find the difference between what Raymond and David do, we subtract: 200 - 100 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
 Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.  If David does one fourth of what Sarah does, then David does 1/4 * 400 = 100 pounds.  If Raymond does half as much as Sarah, then Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds.  The difference between 200 and 100 is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.  The answer is 100. 
 Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.  Since Raymond does half as much laundry, Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.  Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.  To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, subtract what David does from what Raymond does.  200 - 100 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
 Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.  David does 1/4 of what Sarah does.  400 / 4 is 100.  So David does 100 pounds of laundry.  If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, he does half of 400, which is 200 pounds of laundry.  The difference between what Raymond does and what David does is 200 - 100 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
 Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.  David does 1/4 of Sarah's laundry.  400 x 1/4 is 100.  So David does 100 pounds of laundry.  Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.  Half of 400 is 200.  The difference is 200 - 100 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
 Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.  Since Sarah does four times the laundry as David, David does 400/4 = 100 pounds of laundry.  Raymond does half the laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400/2 = 200 pounds of laundry.  

The difference between Raymond's laundry and David's laundry is 200 - 100 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
 Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and David does 1/4 of what Sarah does, David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.  
Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.  
To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we just subtract: 200 - 100 = 100.  The answer is 100 pounds. 
 If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, then David does 400 divided by 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.  If Raymond does half as much as Sarah, then he does 400 divided by 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.  Now we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry they do.  The difference is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds of laundry.  The answer is 100. 
 Let's start by using the information that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.  Let's say David does x pounds of laundry.  Then Sarah does 4x pounds of laundry. 

The problem states that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so we can set up the equation 4x = 400.  To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4: x = 400/4 = 100. 

So David does 100 pounds of laundry, and Sarah does 4 times as much, or 400 pounds. 

The problem also states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.  Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, Raymond does half of that, which is 400/2 = 200 pounds of laundry. 

The question asks for the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do.  We can calculate this by subtracting the amount of laundry David does from the amount Raymond does: 200 - 100 = 100. 

The answer is 100. 
 Let's start by finding the amount of laundry done by David.  Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, David does 1/4 of the laundry that Sarah does.  Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, David does 1/4 x 400 pounds of laundry.  1/4 x 400 is 100 pounds of laundry. 

Now, since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, Raymond does 1/2 x 400 pounds of laundry.  1/2 x 400 is 200 pounds of laundry. 

To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does.  200 - 100 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
 First, we have to calculate the amount of laundry that David does.  Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.  400 pounds is also the amount of laundry that Sarah does.  So David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.  

Next, we have to calculate the amount of laundry that Raymond does.  Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.  So Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry. 

Finally, we have to calculate the difference between 200 and 100.  200 - 100 is 100.  The answer is 100.

[EXP] 13: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Let's say the number of games they lost is x. 

Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8. 

The total number of games they played is 22, which is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So, they lost 7 games.  To find the number of games they won, add 8 to the number of games they lost:

x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

The answer is 15. 
 Let's first find the number of games they lost.  Let's call the number of games they lost x.  Since they won 8 more games than they lost, they won x + 8 games. 

We know that the total number of games they played is 22, so the number of games they lost plus the number of games they won is equal to 22:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So they lost 7 games.  Since they won 8 more games than they lost, they won:

7 + 8 = 15

games.  The answer is 15. 
 The football team played 22 games.  They won 8 more than they lost.  Let's say they lost x games.  Then they won 8 more, so they won x + 8 games.  We know that the total number of games played is 22, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 8) = 22.  Combine like terms to get 2x + 8 = 22.  Subtract 8 from both sides to get 2x = 14.  Divide both sides by 2 to get x = 7.  Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 games.  The answer is 15. 
 Let's call the number of games they lost x.  Then, the number of games they won is x + 8.  The total number of games is 22, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide by 2: x = 7

So, they lost 7 games.  Since they won 8 more games than they lost, they won 7 + 8 = 15 games.  The answer is 15. 
 Let's start with the fact that they won 8 more games than they lost.  Let's say the number of games they lost is x.  Then, the number of games they won is x + 8. 

We know they played a total of 22 games, so the sum of the games they won and lost is 22.  We can write an equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So they lost 7 games.  They won 8 more than they lost, so they won 7 + 8 = 15 games.  The answer is 15. 
 Let's start with the fact that the team played 22 games.  We're told they won 8 more games than they lost, so let's call the number of games they lost "x".  Then the number of games they won is x + 8. 

We know that the total number of games played is the sum of the games won and the games lost, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

So the team lost 7 games.  Since they won 8 more games than they lost, they won 7 + 8 = 15 games.  The answer is 15. 
 If the team won 8 more games than they lost, that means the number of games won is 8 more than the number of games lost.  Let's use the variable x to represent the number of games lost. 

The team won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games won is x + 8. 

The total number of games played is 22, so the total number of games won and lost is also 22. 

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

So the team lost 7 games.  Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won 7 + 8 = 15 games. 

The answer is 15. 
22 games were played.  The team won 8 more than they lost.  Let's say the number of games they lost is x.  Then the number of games they won is x + 8.  The total is the sum of the games they won and lost: x + (x + 8) = 22.  Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 22.  Subtract 8 from both sides to get 2x = 14.  Divide both sides by 2 to get x = 7.  Since the number of games they lost is 7, the number of games they won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
 Let's start with the assumption that the number of games lost is x. 

Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won is x + 8. 

The total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the number of games won and lost is 22. 

We can set up an equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide by 2:

x = 7

The team lost 7 games. 

The team won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games won is:

7 + 8 = 15

The answer is 15. 
 Let's say the number of games the team lost is x.  Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.  The total number of games is the sum of the games won and the games lost, so we can write the equation x + (x + 8) = 22.  Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 8 = 22.  Subtracting 8 from both sides gives 2x = 14.  Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 7.  Since the team won x + 8 games, the number of games they won is 7 + 8 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
 The team played 22 games in total.  They won 8 more than they lost, so let x be the number of games they lost.  The number of games they won would be x + 8.  The total number of games is the sum of the number of games they lost and the number of games they won, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 8) = 22.  Combining like terms, 2x + 8 = 22.  Subtracting 8 from both sides, 2x = 14.  Dividing both sides by 2, x = 7.  The number of games they lost is 7.  The number of games they won is 7 + 8 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
 Let's start by using the symbol "W" for the number of games won and "L" for the number of games lost.  We know that the total number of games played is 22, so we can write the equation:

W + L = 22

We also know that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write the equation:

W = L + 8

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

(L + 8) + L = 22

Combine like terms:

2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

L = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting L into one of the original equations:

W = L + 8
= 7 + 8
= 15

The answer is 15. 
 If the team won 8 more games than they lost, it means the number of games they won minus the number of games they lost is 8. 

Let's say the number of games they lost is x. 
Then, the number of games they won is x + 8, because they won 8 more games than they lost. 

The total number of games they played is 22, so the sum of the number of games they won and the number of games they lost is 22:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So the team lost 7 games.  Since they won 8 more games than they lost, they won 7 + 8 = 15 games. 

The answer is 15. 
 Let's say the number of games won by the team is x.  Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games lost is x - 8. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the number of games won and the number of games lost is also 22.  We can set up the equation:

x + (x - 8) = 22

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 8 = 22

Adding 8 to both sides of the equation, we get:

2x = 30

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:

x = 15

So, the number of games won by the team is 15.  The number of games lost is 15 - 8 = 7. 

So, the answer is 15. 
22 games were played.  The team won 8 more than they lost.  Let's call the number of games they lost "x".  Then, the number of games they won would be x + 8 (since they won 8 more).  The total number of games is 22.  

So, the equation is: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

So, the team lost 7 games.  To find the number of games they won, we add 8 to 7: 7 + 8 = 15

The answer is 15. 
22 games were played.  The team won 8 more than they lost.  Let's represent the number of games they lost as X.  The number of games they won will be X + 8.  The total number of games is the sum of the number of games they won and lost: X + (X + 8) = 22.  Simplifying: 2X + 8 = 22.  Subtracting 8 from both sides: 2X = 14.  Dividing both sides by 2: X = 7.  So, they lost 7 games.  Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won 7 + 8 = 15 games.  The answer is 15. 
22 games played in total, and they won 8 more than they lost.  Let's say they lost x.  That means they must have won x + 8.  x + (x + 8) = 22.  So 2x + 8 = 22.  2x = 22 - 8.  2x = 14.  x = 7.  So they lost 7 games.  And they won x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
 If the team won 8 more than they lost, it means the number of wins is 8 more than the number of losses.  Let's call the number of losses "x".  

The number of wins is x + 8. 

The total number of games played is 22.  

So, the number of losses (x) plus the number of wins (x + 8) equals the total number of games (22).  

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So, the team lost 7 games.  

The number of wins is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15. 

The answer is 15. 
 If the team won 8 more games than they lost, that means if we let x be the number of games they lost, they won x + 8 games.  They played 22 games in total, so the number of games they won plus the number of games they lost should be equal to 22.  We can set up an equation: x + (x + 8) = 22.  We can simplify the equation by combining like terms: 2x + 8 = 22.  Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 14.  Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 7.  Since x is the number of games they lost, they lost 7 games.  They won 8 more games than they lost, so they won 7 + 8 = 15 games.  The answer is 15.

 Let's break this problem down step by step!

Cindy has 4 pets. 

Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. 

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 6 x 3 = 18 pets. 

To find the total number of pets, add the number of pets each has:

4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28

The answer is 28. 
 Cindy has 4 pets. 

Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. 

Jan has three times the pets as Marcia, so Jan has 6 * 3 = 18 pets. 

In total, the three have 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets.  The answer is 28. 
 If Cindy has 4 pets, then Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.  If Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, then she has 6 x 3 = 18 pets.  In total, there are 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets.  The answer is 28. 
 Let's start by finding out how many pets Marcia has.  Cindy has 4 pets, and Marcia has 2 more than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. 

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 x 6 = 18 pets. 

To find the total number of pets they have, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28 pets. 

The answer is 28. 
 Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.  Jan has 3 times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 x 6 = 18 pets.  So in total they have 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28 pets.  The answer is 28. 
 Let's start with Cindy, who has 4 pets.  Marcia has 2 more than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.  Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 6 * 3 = 18 pets.  To find the total number of pets, add up all 3 numbers: 4 + 6 + 18 = 28.  The answer is 28. 
 Let's start by using the information given: Cindy has 4 pets. 

 Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. 

 Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 6 * 3 = 18 pets.

 The answer is 28. 
 Let's start by finding the number of pets Marcia has.  If Cindy has 4 pets and Marcia has 2 more, then Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. 

Now, we know that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.  To find the number of pets Jan has, we multiply Marcia's number of pets by 3: 6 x 3 = 18 pets. 

Finally, we add the number of pets Cindy, Marcia, and Jan have to find the total number of pets: 4 + 6 + 18 = 28. 

The answer is 28. 
 Cindy has 4 pets.  Marcia has 2 more, so she has 4 + 2 = 6.  Jan has three times more pets as Marcia, so he has 6 * 3 = 18 pets.  There are 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets in total.  The answer is 28. 
 First we have to determine how many pets Marcia and Jan have.  Since Cindy has 4 pets, and Marcia has 2 more, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.  Jan has three times as many as Marcia, so Jan has 6 x 3 = 18 pets.  Then we can add up all of their pets: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.  The answer is 28.

[EXP] 18: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 95200, [output]: 4 years ago, Adrien's salary was 40000.  30% of 40000 is 12000, so Lylah's salary was 40000 - 12000 = 28000.  4 years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%.  40% of 40000 is 16000.  So his salary is 40000 + 16000 = 56000.  Lylah's salary also increased by 40%.  40% of 28000 is 11200.  So Lylah's salary is 28000 + 11200 = 39200.  The total salary of both of them is 56000 + 39200 = 95200.  The answer is 95200. 
4 years ago, Adrien's salary was $40000.  Lylah's salary was 30% less than this, so her salary was 0. 7 * 40000 = 28000. 

Adrien's salary was 40% higher than it was 4 years ago, so it is now 1. 4 * 40000 = 56000. 

Since both Adrien and Lylah's salary increased, we add 40% to their salaries from 4 years ago, so Lylah's salary is 1. 4 * 28000 = 39200. 

Now we add their salaries to get 56000 + 39200 = 95200.  The answer is 95200. 
 First, find Lylah's salary.  Her salary is 30% lower than Adrien's salary.  Adrien's salary was $40000.  So Lylah's salary was 70% of this, or 0. 7 x 40000 = 28000.  Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so he earned 1. 4 x 40000 = 56000.  If Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, they both earned 40% more than they did four years ago.  So they both earned 1. 4 times their salaries four years ago.  Adrien earned 1. 4 x 40000 = 56000.  Lylah's salary would be 1. 4 x 28000 = 39200.  The total salary of Adrien and Lylah is 56000 + 39200 = 95200.  The answer is 95200. 
4 years ago, Adrien's salary was $40000.  Adrien is making 30% more than Lylah, so Lylah's salary at that time was 40000 * 0. 7 = 28000.  

Then, 4 years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40% more than before.  So his salary was 40000 * 1. 4 = 56000. 

The amount of salary increase for both Adrien and Lylah is the same.  So Lylah's salary also increased by 40% more, from 28000 to 28000 * 1. 4 = 39200. 

Total salary 4 years later is the sum of Adrien's and Lylah's salaries: 56000 + 39200 = 95200.  The answer is 95200. 
4 years ago, Adrien's salary was $40000.  This was 30% more than Lylah's salary.  So Lylah's salary was 100% - 30% = 70% of 40000, which is 0. 7 x 40000 = 28000.  To find Adrien's salary 4 years later, we first find the percentage increase.  He was earning 40% more than he was 4 years ago, so we need to increase his salary by 40%.  To do this, we multiply his salary by 1 + 0. 4 = 1. 4.  So his salary 4 years later is 1. 4 x 40000 = 56000.  

Lylah's salary 4 years later is also 40% more than what she was earning 4 years ago.  So she earns 1. 4 times her original salary.  1. 4 x 28000 is 39200. 

We want their total salary 4 years later.  To find their total, we add Adrien's salary 4 years later and Lylah's salary 4 years later.  This is 56000 + 39200 = 95200.  The answer is 95200.

 On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.  Tuesday, he walked 6 times that, which is 6 * 4 = 24 miles.  The total mileage Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.  If we subtract the mileage on Monday and Tuesday, which is 4 + 24 = 28, we get 41 - 28 = 13 miles on Wednesday.  The answer is 13. 
 Let's break this down step by step!

Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 6 x 4 = 24 miles. 

So, the total mileage from Monday to Tuesday is:
4 (Monday) + 24 (Tuesday) = 28 miles. 

Since the total mileage from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles, we subtract the total mileage from Monday to Tuesday (28 miles) from the total:
41 - 28 = 13 miles

Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday. 

The answer is 13. 
 On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.  Then on Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday.  Since 6 x 4 = 24, he walked 24 miles on Tuesday.  In total, his mileage was 4 + 24 = 28.  The total mileage from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles.  So the mileage on Wednesday can be found by subtracting 28 from 41.  41 - 28 = 13.  The answer is 13. 
 Walt started off by walking 4 miles on Monday.  Then he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday.  6 times 4 is 24, so he walked 24 miles on Tuesday.  4 + 24 = 28 miles total by Tuesday.  We are told he walked 41 miles from Monday to Wednesday.  So he must have walked 41 - 28 = 13 miles on Wednesday.  The answer is 13. 
 Walt has already walked 4 + 6 * 4 = 4 + 24 = 28 miles from monday to tuesday.  So the miles walked on wednesday is the total - the miles from monday and tuesday.  41 - 28 = 13.  The answer is 13. 
 Let's break it down step by step.  On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.  On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 4 x 6 = 24 miles on Tuesday.  His total mileage Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles, so he must have walked an additional miles on Wednesday to reach a total of 41.  Let's set up an equation:
4 (Monday) + 24 (Tuesday) + x (Wednesday) = 41
Add the first two terms: 4 + 24 = 28
Now rewrite the equation with 28 as the first term:
28 + x = 41
Subtract 28 from both sides:
x = 41 - 28
x = 13
So Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.  The answer is 13.

[EXP] 22: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 75, [output]: 30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours.  Then half that many, 15, returned in the next 6 hours.  In the next 6 hours, twice as many, 30 * 2 = 60, left the hive.  After this, all bees that left earlier, which were 30, return to the hive.  So in the last 6 hours, 30 bees returned to the hive.  The answer is 30. 
30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then 1/2 that many bees return, which is 30/2 = 15.  Then 2 times that many bees leave, which is 2 x 30 = 60.  So in total 30 + 60 = 90 bees left.  All 30 bees that left before will now return.  The answer is 30. 
30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours.  Then 1/2 as many return in the next 6 hours, so 15 bees return.  Then twice as many as the original 30 bees leave, which is 2 x 30 = 60.  So 60 bees leave.  Now, Debra sees every bee that left before return to the hive in the last 6 hours.  This means 30 bees return.  The answer is 30. 
30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.  Then 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours.  1/2 of 30 is 15.  So 15 bees return in the next 6 hours. 

In the next 6 hours, 2 times as many bees as the original 30 leave the hive.  2 * 30 is 60.  So 60 bees leave the hive in the next 6 hours. 

Debra has seen a total of 30 bees leave the hive before the last 6 hours.  30 bees haven't returned yet.  30 bees return in the last 6 hours.  The answer is 30. 
30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours.  Then 1/2 that many (1/2 x 30 = 15) returned in the next 6 hours.  Then Debra sees 2 times as many bees as she saw first leave (2 x 30 = 60) leave the hive and fly away in the next 6 hours.  So 30 bees haven't returned yet.  Then every bee that left before that returns to the hive.  That is, 30 bees return now.  The answer is 30 bees. 
30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours.  1/2 as many bees return in the next 6 hours, so 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.  Then, twice as many bees leave in the next 6 hours, so 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave.  So, before the last 6 hours, 30 + 60 = 90 bees left the hive.  Then, all bees that left before that haven't already returned return to the hive.  That's 30 bees, as all the bees that left in the first 6 hours returned in the next 6 hours.  30 bees return in the last 6 hours.  The answer is 30. 
 Debra started with 30 bees that left the hive.  Then she saw 1/2 that many bees, or 30/2 = 15 bees, return to the hive.  Then she saw two times as many bees leave the hive, or 2 x 30 = 60 bees, but that is after those 30 bees left earlier.  So there are still 30 bees left.  The answer is 30. 
30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours.  Then 30 / 2 = 15 bees returned.  This means 15 bees had left the hive but returned, and 30 - 15 = 15 bees had left the hive and not returned.  Then, twice as many bees (which would be 30) leave the hive, so 30 * 2 = 60 bees.  After that, every bee that hadn't returned yet returns.  So, 15 bees return.  In total, 15 + 15 = 30 bees return in the last 6 hours.  The answer is 30. 
30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours.  Then 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours.  So 30 / 2 = 15.  Therefore, in the first 12 hours, 30 + 15 = 45 bees left, and 15 returned.  

Next, we know that twice as many bees left than the first time, or 2 x 30 = 60 bees left in the next 6 hours.  And every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns in the next 6 hours.  So, there are 45 - 15 = 30 bees that left the hive in the first 12 hours and hadn't returned yet.  So, 30 bees return in the last 6 hours.  The answer is 30. 
30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.  In the next 6 hours, half of that many, or 15 bees, return to the hive.  In the next 6 hours, Debra sees 2 times as many bees as originally left the hive, which is 2 x 30 = 60 bees.  However, bees that left before that but had not returned are now returning, and Debra counts these.  Since 30 bees left but 15 returned, 15 bees hadn't returned.  So the last 6 hours, Debra sees 15 + 15 = 30 bees return to the hive.  The answer is 30. 
30 bees left the hive initially.  Then 30 / 2 = 15 bees returned.  So 30 - 15 = 15 bees were left.  Later, two times as many bees left as left initially, so 2 * 30 = 60 bees left.  So 15 bees that remained joined 15 bees that left earlier.  15 + 15 = 30.  So 30 bees that left earlier had returned, and now only 30 bees that left in the last hour remain.  The answer is 30.

[EXP] 23: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 272, [output]: 1 hour classes * 3 classes * 3 days = 9 hours per week.  
2 hour classes * 2 classes * 2 days = 8 hours per week. 

Total hours per week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours. 

In one semester, there are 16 weeks.  
So total hours Kimo spends attending classes = 17 hours per week * 16 weeks = 272 hours. 

The answer is 272. 
 Since Kimo has 3 1-hour classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, that is 3 * 3 * 1 = 9 class hours per week on those days.  On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 2-hour classes, which is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 hours.  9 + 8 hours is 17 hours.  There are 16 weeks of school, so 16 * 17 is 272 hours.  The answer is 272. 
3 classes per day for 3 days (Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays) will be 3 * 3 = 9 classes.  Each class is 1 hour, so this will be 9 * 1 = 9 hours.  For the other 2 days (Tuesdays and Thursdays), he has 2 * 2-hour classes, which is 4 classes.  Each class is 2 hours long, so this will be 4 * 2 = 8 hours.  So in total, Kimo has 9 + 8 = 17 hours.  This is per week, and there are 16 weeks in the semester.  So in total, Kimo has 16 * 17 = 272 hours of classes in the semester.  The answer is 272. 
 Kimo attends 3 classes each on 3 days, which is 3 x 3 = 9 classes each week.   Then he attends 2 classes each on 2 days, which is 2 x 2 = 4 classes each week.   In total, he has 9 + 4 = 13 classes per week.   In 16 weeks, he has 13 x 16 = 208 classes.   Each class is 1 hour on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 2 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.   So he attends 1 hour x 9 + 2 hours x 4 = 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours of classes per week.   In 16 weeks, he attends 17 x 16 = 272 hours of class.   The answer is 272. 
16 weeks in a semester.  Each week, Kimo has 3 * 3 = 9 hours of class on M-W-F.  2 hours each on T-Th, so 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 hours.  9 weekday hours + 8 Tuesday/Thursday hours = 17 hours per week.  17 hours per week * 16 weeks in a semester = 17 * 16 = 272.  The answer is 272. 
 Kimo has 3 classes each on monday, wednesday, and friday for a total of 6 classes.  Each class is 1 hour, so Kimo has 3 x 1 x 3 = 9 hours on these days.  On tuesday and thursday, he has 2 classes, each 2 hours long, for a total of 4 hours.  4 hours each day for 2 days will be 2 x 4 = 8 hours.  So in total Kimo has 9 + 8 = 17 hours.  There are 16 weeks of school, so Kimo has 17 hours x 16 weeks = 272 hours.  The answer is 272. 
3 classes each on 3 days is 3 x 3 = 9 classes per week.  Each class is 1 hour long.  So Kimo spends 9 hours in class on each of those days.  

On Tuedays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 2-hour classes.  That is 4 hours of class per day.  For both days, that's 4 * 2 = 8 hours.  

So in total, Kimo spends 9 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays and 8 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  In one week, he spends 9 + 8 = 17 hours.  

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, Kimo would attend 16 * 17 = 272 hours in a semester.  The answer is 272. 
 We need to find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester. 

Question breaks down into smaller steps:

1.  First we calculate the total hours Kimo spends in one week.  On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day.  Each class lasts one hour, so in total he has 3 hours per day for those 3 days.  So that is 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week. 

2.  Next, from Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours.  So he has 2 * 2 = 4 hours for each of those 2 days.  In total, that is 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week. 

3.  So in total Kimo spends 9 + 8 = 17 hours per week. 

4.  One semester is 16 weeks.  So in 16 weeks, Kimo spends 16 * 17 = 272 hours. 

The answer is 272 hours.

To find the total number of fish caught, add Anakin's catch to Locsin's catch: 19 + 13 = 32. 

The answer is 32. 
 Let's first find out how many fish Anakin caught:

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Total fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin = 19 + 13 = 32

The answer is 32. 
 Let's start by finding the number of starfish Anakin caught.  Anakin caught 10 starfish.  Locsin caught 5 fewer than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.  In total, they caught 10 + 5 = 15 starfish. 

Next, let's find the number of sea horses they caught.  Anakin caught 6 sea horses.  Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.  In total, they caught 6 + 3 = 9 sea horses. 

Finally, let's find the number of clownfish they caught.  Anakin caught 3 clownfish.  Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.  In total, they caught 3 + 5 = 8 clownfish. 

To find the total number of fish they caught, add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish: 15 + 9 + 8 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.  So the total number of fish he caught is:

10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish) = 19

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. 

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. 

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish. 

The total number of fish Locsin caught is:

5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish) = 13

To find the total number of fish they caught, add the number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:

19 (Anakin) + 13 (Locsin) = 32

The answer is 32. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Anakin caught:
10 starfish
6 sea horses
3 clownfish
Total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Locsin caught:
5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish
Total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Together, they caught:
Anakin: 19
Locsin: 13
Total: 19 + 13 = 32

The answer is 32. 
 Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.  Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.  Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.  Locsin caught 2 more clownfish, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.  To find the total number of fish caught by both, we add up their fish: 19 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
 Let's analyze the problem:

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Total fishes caught by Anakin: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Total fishes caught by Locsin: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Total fishes caught by both Anakin and Locsin: 19 + 13 = 32

The answer is 32. 
 Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.  Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish, 3 fewer sea horses, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin.  This means Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish, 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses, and 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.  In total, they caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.  Total fish Anakin and Locsin caught is 19 + 13 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
 Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.  So in total Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19.  

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish, which is 10 - 5 = 5.  Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses, which is 6 - 3 = 3.  Locsin caught 2 more clownfish, which is 3 + 2 = 5.  

So Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13.  In total, they caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish.  

The answer is 32. 
 Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.  So, in total he caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish. 

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. 

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. 

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish. 

In total, they caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.  Adding the 19 fish Anakin caught and the 13 fish Locsin caught, they caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish in total.  The answer is 32. 
 Let's start by identifying the number of fish Anakin caught:

Anakin caught:
10 starfish
6 sea horses
3 clownfish

In total, Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish

Now, let's identify the number of fish Locsin caught:

Locsin caught:
5 fewer starfish than Anakin: 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
2 more clownfish than Anakin: 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

In total, Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish

Now, let's add the number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:

19 (Anakin) + 13 (Locsin) = 32

So, Anakin and Locsin caught a total of 32 fish.  The answer is 32. 
 Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.  So, Anakin has a total of 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.  Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish and 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin.  So, Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish and 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.  Locsin also caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.  Then, Locsin has a total of 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.  In total, they caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish.  The answer is 32. 
 Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.  Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish, which is 10 - 5 = 5.  Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses, which is 6 - 3 = 3.  Locsin caught 2 more clownfish, which is 3 + 2 = 5. 

Anakin's fish total is 10 + 6 + 3 = 19.  Locsin's fish total is 5 + 3 + 5 = 13. 

So together they found 19 + 13 = 32 fish.  The answer is 32. 
 Let's identify the number of fish each person caught:

Anakin caught:

* 10 starfish
* 6 sea horses
* 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:

* Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin, so 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
* Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin, so 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
* Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin, so 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

In total, they caught:
* Starfish: 10 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 15
* Sea horses: 6 (Anakin) + 3 (Locsin) = 9
* Clownfish: 3 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 8

To find the total number of fish, add the counts: 15 + 9 + 8 = 32

The answer is 32. 
 Let's start with Anakin.  He caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.  So, in total, Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish. 

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. 

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. 

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish. 

The total number of fish caught by both of them is:
Anakin: 19 fish
Locsin: 5 starfish, 3 sea horses, 5 clownfish = 13 fish

So, in total, they caught: 19 + 13 = 32 fish. 

The answer is 32. 
 Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

 Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish, which means 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. 
 Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses, which means 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. 
 Locsin caught 2 more clownfish, which means 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish. 

 So Locsin caught 5 starfish, 3 sea horses, and 5 clownfish. 

 To find the total number of fish they caught, we add the number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:

 Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish. 
 Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish. 
 In total, they caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish.

[EXP] 27: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 23, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

First, Jan is 30 years old.  Two years ago, she was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. 

Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age two years ago, so Mark was 5 + 14 = 19 years old two years ago. 

Now, Mark is 19 + 2 = 21 years old. 

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old. 

The answer is 23. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step!

1.  Two years ago, Jan's age was 30 - 2 = 28. 
2.  Mark's age two years ago was 5 years older than half of Jan's age two years ago.  So, Mark's age two years ago was 28/2 + 5 = 19. 
3.  Since Mark's age two years ago was 19, his current age would be 19 + 2 = 21. 
4.  Jean is two years older than Mark, so her current age would be 21 + 2 = 23. 

The answer is 23. 
 Jan is 30 years old.  Two years ago, she was 30 - 2 = 28.  So mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.  Half of 28 is 14, so Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 two years ago.  So Mark is now 19 + 2 = 21.  Jean is 2 years older than Mark, so Jean is 21 + 2 = 23.  The answer is 23. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step!

Jean is two years older than Mark, so if Mark's current age is M, Jean's age is M + 2. 

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age, which is (30 - 2) / 2 = 14.  So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old. 

Since two years ago, Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21. 

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23. 

The answer is 23. 
2 years ago, Jan's age was 30 - 2 = 28.  Since two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half of that, then Mark's age 2 years ago was 5 + 14 = 19.  Today, Mark's age is 19 + 2 = 21.  Now we know that Jean is 2 years older than Mark, so Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23.  The answer is 23. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step.  

1.  Jan is 30.  Two years ago, she was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. 
2.  Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age two years ago, so he was 5 + (28/2) = 5 + 14 = 19 years old two years ago. 
3.  Mark is currently two years older than Mark, so he is 19 + 2 = 21 years old. 
4.  Jean is two years older than Mark, so she is 21 + 2 = 23 years old. 

The answer is 23. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

First, we know that Jean is 2 years older than Mark, so let's say Mark's current age is M.  Then Jean's current age is M + 2. 

Two years ago, Mark's age was M - 2.  Jan's current age is 30, so two years ago she was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. 

The problem states that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age, so we can set up an equation:

M - 2 = 5 + (28/2)

Simplify the equation by multiplying 28 by 1/2:

M - 2 = 5 + 14

Add 2 to both sides:

M = 21

So Mark is currently 21 years old.  Since Jean is 2 years older than Mark, Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old. 

The answer is 23. 
 Since Jan is 30, we know that Jan's age two years ago was 28.  We also know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.  Half Jan's age is 28 / 2 = 14.  So Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 two years ago.  

To find Mark's current age, we add 2, so his current age is 19 + 2 = 21.  

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23.  

The answer is 23. 
 Let's start by identifying the information we have:

* Jean is 2 years older than Mark. 
* 2 years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
* Jan is currently 30 years old. 

Let's convert the statement "2 years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age" into a mathematical equation.  Two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.  Half of 28 is 14.  So, 2 years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old. 

Now, since Jean is 2 years older than Mark, Jean's age 2 years ago is 19 + 2 = 21.  Since we know Jean's age now is 2 years more than her age 2 years ago, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23. 

The answer is 23. 
 First, we have to figure out Mark's age.  Since Jan is 30, and two years ago Mark was half of Jan's age, 2 years ago Mark was half of 28, or 14.  So 2 years ago Mark was 5 years older than 14, or 19.  Since we want to know Mark's current age, we add 2 to 19 to get 21. 

Jean is 2 years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is 2 years more than Mark's, or 23. 

The answer is 23. 
 First, let's figure out how old Mark is.  Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.  Two years ago, Jan was 28, because she is currently 30 and 2 years old ago she wasn't yet 30.  Mark was 5 years older than half of 28.  Half of 28 is 14, so 14 + 5 = 19.  Mark was 19 2 years ago.  Therefore, Mark is 21 now, because he is 2 years older now than he was 2 years ago.  Jean is 2 years older than Mark.  So Jean is 23.  The answer is 23. 
 Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.  Two years ago, Mark's age was:

Year ago (M) = 5 + (Half of Jan's age 2 years ago)

Two years ago, Jan's age was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. 

So, two years ago, Mark's age was 5 + (Half of 28) = 5 + 14 = 19. 

This means Mark was 19 two years ago, which means his current age is 21. 

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is 23. 

The answer is 23. 
 We are told that Jean is 2 years older than Mark.   Let's call Mark's age M, then Jean's age is M + 2.   We are also told that two years ago Mark's age was 5 years more than half Jan's age 2 years ago.   If Jan is 30, then 2 years ago she was 28.   So Mark was M - 2 years old.   Half of 28 is 14, and 5 years more than that is 19.   So M - 2 = 19. 

M = 19 + 2 = 21

Since Mark's age is 21, Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23

The answer is 23. 
 Let's break this down step by step!

First, Jan is 30, and Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is Jan's age + 2 = 30 + 2 = 32. 

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.  So, two years ago, Mark's age was (30 - 2) / 2 + 5. 

First, let's calculate (30 - 2) / 2 = 28 / 2 = 14.  Then, add 5: 14 + 5 = 19. 

Now we know two years ago Mark was 19.  To find Mark's current age, we add 2: 19 + 2 = 21. 

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23. 

Wait, we said Jean is 32! There's a mistake somewhere.  Let's re-examine the equation. 

(Mark's age) = (Jan's age - 2) / 2 + 5

We know Jan's age is 30, so plug it in: (Mark's age) = (30 - 2) / 2 + 5

= (28) / 2 + 5

= 14 + 5

= 19

Two years ago, Mark was 19, so his current age is 19 + 2 = 21. 

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23. 

The answer is 23. 
 Let's break this down step by step:

1.  Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
   So, Mark's age 2 years ago was 5 years plus half of Jan's age 2 years ago. 
   Let's call Jan's age 2 years ago 'j'.  Then half of 'j' is 'j/2'. 
   So, Mark's age 2 years ago was 5 + j/2. 
2.  But Mark's age 2 years ago was M - 2, since 2 years have passed. 
   So, M - 2 = 5 + j/2. 
   'M' is unknown, so we'll work with this equation: M - 2 = 5 + j/2. 
3.  Jan's age is currently 30. 
   So, her age 2 years ago was 30 - 2 = 28. 
   The expression 'j' is Jan's age 2 years ago, which is 28. 
4.  Now, we can plug in the known value of 'j' in the equation we created in step 2. 
   M - 2 = 5 + 28/2  (Since j is 28)
   M - 2 = 5 + 14  (28/2 is 14)
   M - 2 = 19
   M = 21  (Adding 2 to both sides)
5.  Jean is 2 years older than Mark. 
   So, Jean's age is 2 years more than Mark's age. 
   Since Mark's age is 21, Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23. 
   The answer is 23.

3 friends spent $20. 25 on the tickets. 

They spent $4. 50 less on food than on the tickets.  So they spent 20. 25 - 4. 50 = 15. 75 on food. 

Then they went on 2 different rides which cost $33 each.  So they spent 33 x 2 = 66 on the rides. 

In total, they spent 20. 25 + 15. 75 + 66 = 102 dollars.  Split evenly between the 3 friends, they each pay 102 / 3 = 34. 

The answer is 34. 
3 friends spent 20. 25 dollars on tickets.  They spent 4. 50 dollars less on food than on the tickets.  So on food, they spent 20. 25 - 4. 50 = 15. 75 dollars.  20. 25 + 15. 75 is 36.  They also spent 33 dollars each on 2 rides, so that is 33 * 2 = 66.  The total cost is 36 + 66 = 102 dollars.  Dividing 102 by 3 friends gives us 102 ÷ 3 = 34 dollars.  The answer is 34. 
 First, we focus on the tickets and food.  They spent 20. 25 dollars on tickets.  They spent 4. 50 dollars less on food, so they spent 20. 25 - 4. 50 = 15. 75 dollars on food.  So in total they spent 20. 25 + 15. 75 = 36 dollars on tickets and food.  Then they went on 2 rides, each for 33 dollars.  So they spent 2 x 33 = 66 dollars on rides.  In total, they spent 36 + 66 = 102 dollars.  Since they are splitting it evenly among 3 people, we divide 102 by 3, which is 34.  The answer is 34. 
3 friends spent $20. 25 on 3 tickets.  So they spent 20. 25 / 3 = $6. 75 per person. 

They also spent $4. 50 less on food.  So they spent 20. 25 - 4. 50 = 15. 75 on food.  Since they split this evenly, they each paid 15. 75 / 3 = $5. 25. 

They also spent $33 for each of 2 rides.  So they spent 2 * 33 = 66 dollars.  They split this evenly, so each paid 66 / 3 = $22. 

In total, each person paid 6. 75 (on tickets) + 5. 25 (on food) + 22 (on rides) = 34 dollars.  The answer is 34. 
3 friends spent 20. 25 dollars on 3 tickets to the fair.  So the cost of the tickets is 20. 25 / 3 = 6. 75 dollars per friend. 

For food, they spent 4. 50 less than on tickets.  So they spent 20. 25 - 4. 50 = 15. 75 dollars on food.  This is split evenly, so the cost of food per friend is 15. 75 / 3 = 5. 25 dollars. 

Then they went on 2 rides which cost 33 dollars each.  So the total cost of the ride is 2 x 33 = 66.  This is split evenly, so the cost of the ride per friend is 66 / 3 = 22. 

The total cost per friend is 6. 75 + 5. 25 + 22 = 34 dollars.  The answer is 34. 
3 friends spent 20. 25 dollars on tickets.  Then they spent 4. 50 less on food than on the tickets.  That means they spent 20. 25 - 4. 50 = 15. 75 on food.  Total they spent 20. 25 + 15. 75 = 36 dollars.  The two rides cost 33 * 2 = 66 dollars in total.  The cost is 36 + 66 = 102 dollars.  Split between 3 friends is 102/3 = 34.  The answer is 34. 
3 friends spent 20. 25 on 3 tickets.  So 1 ticket costs 20. 25 ÷ 3 = 6. 75.  The 3 friends spent 4. 50 less on food than on the tickets.  The tickets cost 20. 25, and the food cost 20. 25 - 4. 50 = 15. 75.  So the cost of food, tickets, and 2 rides is 20. 25 + 15. 75 + 33 x 2 = 20. 25 + 15. 75 + 66 = 102. 25.

They also spent 2 x 33 = 66 dollars on the 2 rides.  So in total, they spent 20. 25 + 15. 75 + 66 = 102 dollars.  They agreed to split it evenly, which means each person should pay the total cost / 3.  102 / 3 = 34.  This means each of the 3 friends paid 34 dollars.  The answer is 34. 
3 friends spent 20. 25 on tickets, so the total cost of tickets is 20. 25.  If the cost of food is 4. 5 less than the cost of tickets, then the cost of food is 20. 25 - 4. 5 = 15. 75.  Total expenses are 15. 75 + 20. 25 = 36.  To go on two rides, it cost 33 x 2 = 66.  Total expenses are 36 + 66 = 102.  Since there were 3 friends, each friend's share is 102 / 3 = 34.  The answer is 34. 
20. 25 is what they spent on tickets.  Let's subtract 4. 50 from that to find out how much they spent on food.  20. 25 - 4. 50 = 15. 75.  That's how much they spent on food.  They also spent 2 x 33 dollars on rides.  So they spent 2 * 33 = 66 dollars on the rides.  In total, they spent 20. 25 + 15. 75 + 66 = 102 dollars.  This 102 dollars needs to be split among 3 people.  To do this, we divide 102 by 3.  102 / 3 = 34.  So each person paid 34 dollars.  The answer is 34. 
20. 25 dollars were spent on 3 tickets to the fair, which is 20. 25 / 3 = 6. 75 dollars per ticket.  Food cost 4. 50 less than the tickets, so it was 20. 25 - 4. 50 = 15. 75.  In total, they spent 20. 25 + 15. 75 = 36 dollars.  And then they spent 2 x 33 = 66 dollars on the two rides.  The total spent is 36 + 66 = 102 dollars. Splitting the cost evenly, each friend should pay 102 / 3 = 34 dollars.  The answer is 34. 
3 friends spent 20. 25 on the tickets.  Then they spent 4. 50 less on food.  Food cost 20. 25 - 4. 50 = 15. 75.  Now they spent 20. 25 on the tickets and 15. 75 on food, so that's a total of 20. 25 + 15. 75 = 36. 00.  They also went on 2 rides, each for 33 dollars, so that's 2 x 33 = 66.  The total they spent was 36 plus 66, or 102 dollars.  If they split it evenly, each person has to pay 102/3 = 34 dollars.  The answer is 34. 
3 friends spent $20. 25 on 3 tickets.  So 3 friends split the $20. 25, that means each friend paid 20. 25 / 3 = $6. 75.  Then they spent $4. 50 less on food than on the tickets means they spent 20. 25 - 4. 50 = 15. 75 dollars on food.  3 friends split the 15. 75, so each friend paid 15. 75 / 3 = $5. 25.  Then they went on 2 different rides which costs $33 for each ride, so they paid 2 x 33 = 66 dollars.  3 friends split 66 dollars, so each friend paid 66 / 3 = 22.  So the total they paid is the sum of what they paid for tickets, food, and rides.  Each friend paid 6. 75 + 5. 25 + 22 = 34 dollars.  The answer is 34. 
3 friends spent $20. 25 on 3 tickets to the fair, that means each ticket cost 20. 25 / 3 = $6. 75.  Then they spent $4. 50 less on food than on the tickets.  So food cost 20. 25 - 4. 50 = 15. 75 dollars.  
The total cost of the day was 6. 75 x 3 = 20. 25 for the tickets, 15. 75 for the food, and 33 * 2 = 66 for the rides.  The total is 20. 25 + 15. 75 + 66 = 102.

[EXP] 30: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 31, [output]:  Carl used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich for 7 days, so 2 x 7 = 14 slices for his sandwiches.  For his omelets, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese per omelet for 3 days, so 3 x 3 = 9 slices for his omelets.  In addition, he used 8 slices of cheese for his macaroni and cheese.  In total, he used 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.  The answer is 31. 
 Carl used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich and ate 7 sandwiches.  So for sandwich, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese.  For omelets, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet and ate 3 omelets, so he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for omelets.  For macaroni and cheese, he used 8 slices.  In total, he used 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.  The answer is 31. 
 To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, let's break it down:

Sandwiches: 7 days * 2 slices per sandwich = 14 slices

Omelets: 3 days * (2 + 1) slices per omelet = 3 * 3 = 9 slices

Macaroni and cheese: 8 slices

Add all the slices together: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese

The answer is 31. 
 Carl ate a slice of cheese for each of 7 sandwiches this week, so 7 x 2 = 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches.  He ate a slice of cheese plus one more for each of 3 omelets, so 3 x 3 = 9 slices of cheese for omelets.  Finally, he used 8 slices of cheese in the macaroni dish.  In total, he used 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.  The answer is 31. 
 Carl started with 0 slices of cheese.  He used 2 slices per sandwich for 7 days, which is 2 x 7 = 14 slices.  He used 1 more slice per omelet than per sandwich, which means he used 3 slices per omelet for 3 days, which is 3 x 3 = 9 slices.  So, in total he used 14 + 9 slices for sandwiches and omelets.  Then, for the macaroni and cheese dish, he used 8 slices.  In total, he used 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.  The answer is 31. 
 Carl used 2 slices of cheese for each of the 7 days for his lunch sandwiches, so that is 2 x 7 = 14 slices.  Then he used 1 more slice for each of the 3 breakfast omelets, so that is 3 x 3 = 9 slices of cheese for the omelets.  Then he used 8 slices in the big dish of macaroni and cheese.  So the total number of slices he used is 14 + 9 + 8 = 31.  The answer is 31. 
 Let's break it down step by step:

1.  He ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.  So for 7 days, he used 2 x 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch. 
2.  He made omelets for breakfast 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than for sandwiches.  So for omelets, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese per omelet.  For 3 omelets, he used 3 x 3 = 9 slices of cheese. 
3.  Finally, he used 8 slices of cheese for the big dish of macaroni and cheese. 

To find the total number of slices of cheese he used, we add up the slices used for lunch, omelets, and macaroni and cheese:

14 (lunch) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31

The answer is 31 slices of cheese. 
 Carl started with 0 slices of cheese.  Here's a breakdown of how he used his cheese:

* Sandwiches: 2 slices per sandwich, and he ate one per day for 7 days, so 2 slices * 7 days = 14 slices
* Omelets: 3 days, 1 more slice per omelet than per sandwich, so 3 slices per omelet.  3 days * 3 slices = 9 slices
* Macaroni and cheese: 8 slices

In total, Carl used 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.  The answer is 31. 
 Carl used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, and he ate a sandwich every day this week, so he used 2 x 7 = 14 slices for the sandwiches.  For his omelets, he used 3 days, and one more slice per omelet than he did for sandwiches, so 3 slices per omelet.  3 omelets will be 3 x 3 = 9 slices.  In total, he used 14 + 9 = 23 slices for the sandwiches and omelets.  He also used 8 slices for the macaroni and cheese.  In total, that is 23 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.  The answer is 31. 
 Let's break it down step by step! Carl ate sandwiches every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, for 7 days (since it's a week).  So that's 7 x 2 = 14 slices of cheese for the sandwiches. 

For breakfast, he ate omelets 3 days, using 3 slices of cheese per omelet, one more slice than for the sandwiches.  So that's 3 x 3 = 9 slices of cheese for the omelets. 

He also made a dish of macaroni and cheese using 8 slices of cheese. 

To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, add up the slices from the sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31

The answer is 31. 
 Let's start by calculating the number of slices of cheese Carl used for his daily sandwich.  He ate 2 slices of cheese per sandwich and had 7 days of lunches.  2 slices x 7 days = 14 slices. 

For his 3 days of breakfast omelets, he used 1 slice of cheese more than for his sandwiches, so he used 3 slices of cheese for each omelet.  3 slices x 3 days = 9 slices. 

Additionally, he used 8 slices of cheese for his macaroni and cheese dish. 

In total, Carl used 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.  The answer is 31. 
 Carl ate 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, so for 7 days (since it was for lunch each day), he ate 2 x 7 = 14 slices of cheese. 

He ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, with one slice per omelet more than the sandwich.  So for omelets, he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese each day for 3 days.  That's 3 x 3 = 9 slices of cheese. 

He also used 8 slices of cheese for the big dish.  To find the total slices of cheese, we add them up: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31.  The answer is 31. 
 Let's solve this problem step by step. 

Carl ate sandwiches for lunch every day, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.  He ate 7 lunches (1 for each day of the week), so that's 7 * 2 = 14 slices of cheese. 

For breakfast, he ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days.  He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, so that's 3 slices per omelet.  He ate 3 omelets, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese. 

He added to this with his 8 slices of cheese from the macaroni and cheese dish. 

To find the total number of slices of cheese, we add up all these amounts: 14 (from sandwiches) + 9 (from omelets) + 8 (from macaroni and cheese) = 31. 

The answer is 31. 
 Carl uses 2 slices per sandwich.  This week he ate a sandwich for 7 days.  So, he used 2 slices per sandwich * 7 days = 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches. 

For cheese and egg omelets, he uses 1 slice more per omelet than sandwich.  He makes 3 omelets.  So, for omelets he uses 3 omelets * 3 slices per omelet = 9 slices. 

He uses 8 slices for the big dish of macaroni and cheese. 

So, in total, he uses 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.   The answer is 31. 
 Carl started out with using 2 slices of cheese per day on his sandwiches.  7 days a week means 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices of cheese.  

For breakfast, he ate 3 omelets.  Since each omelet had one more slice of cheese than a sandwich, that means each omelet had 3 slices.  So for 3 omelets, that’s 3 omelets * 3 slices/omelet = 9 slices. 

For making macaroni and cheese, he used 8 slices of cheese. 

In total, he used 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.  The answer is 31. 
 From the question, we know Carl used 2 slices per sandwich.  
Carl ate a sandwich every day, so he ate 7 sandwiches for lunch.  So, 7 x 2 = 14 slices of cheese were used for sandwiches.  
He ate omelets 3 days in the week, using one more slice than per sandwich.  2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.  
So, for 3 omelets, he used 3 x 3 = 9 slices of cheese for omelets.  
For macaroni and cheese, he used 8 slices of cheese. 
Adding all together, Carl used 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.  The answer is 31.

[EXP] 31: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Sara originally had 10 dollars saved.  She earned 4 x 5 = 20 dollars from babysitting.  The total money she has now is 10 + 20 = 30.  The jacket and shoes cost 30 + 2 x 20 = 30 + 40 = 70 dollars.  So she needs 70 - 30 = 40 dollars more.  She will earn 4 dollars from mowing the lawns, so she needs to mow the lawns 40 / 4 = 10 times.  The answer is 10. 
 Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket for 30 dollars and 2 pairs of shoes for 2 x 20 = 40 dollars.  So she needs 30 + 40 = 70 dollars.  She already has 10 dollars saved.  After babysitting 4 times, she will have 4 x 5 = 20 dollars more.  She now has 10 + 20 = 30 dollars.  She still needs 70 - 30 = 40 dollars to buy the jacket and shoes.  The lawn mower pays her 4 dollars each time.  40 / 4 = 10.  She needs to mow the lawn 10 times.  The answer is 10. 
 Sara wants a new jacket for 30 dollars and 2 pairs of shoes for 2 * 20 = 40 dollars.  So she needs 30 + 40 = 70 dollars in total.  She already had 10 dollars.  After babysitting 4 times, she earned 4 * 5 = 20 dollars.  10 + 20 = 30 dollars.  She now needs 70 - 30 = 40 dollars more.  The lawn work earns 4 dollars each time.  So the number of times she has to mow the lawn to earn 40 more dollars is 40 / 4 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
 Sara already has 10 dollars.  Then she earned 5 dollars each time for babysitting 4 times, which is 5 * 4 = 20 dollars.  Sara wants a jacket for 30 dollars and 2 pairs of shoes for 2 x 20 = 40 dollars.  She needs 30 + 40 = 70 dollars total.  She already has 10 + 20 = 30 dollars, so she still needs 70 - 30 = 40 dollars.  She earns 4 dollars for each time she mows the lawn, so she will need to mow the lawn 40 / 4 = 10 times.  The answer is 10. 
 Sara already has 10 dollars.  She will earn 5 dollars each time she babysits.  The jacket costs 30 dollars and shoes cost 20 dollars each.  So she needs 30 + 20 + 20 = 70 dollars.  She already has 10, so she needs 70 - 10 = 60 more dollars.  From babysitting 4 times, she earned 5 x 4 = 20 dollars.  She is still short 60 - 20 = 40 dollars.  

Since mowing the lawn earns her 4 dollars each time, she will need to mow the lawn 40 / 4 = 10 times to earn the remaining 40 dollars.  The answer is 10. 
 Sara started with $10.  For each of 4 times of babysitting, she earns 5 dollars.  4 * 5 = 20.  So now she has 10 + 20 = 30.  Now she needs 30 dollars for the jacket and shoes.  The jacket is 30 dollars and 2 pairs of shoes are 2 * 20 dollars, which is 40 dollars.  So she needs 30 + 40 = 70 dollars.  She still needs 70 - 30 = 40 dollars.  She gets 4 dollars for each lawn she mows.  To get 40 dollars, she must mow 40/4 = 10 times.  The answer is 10. 
30 is the cost of the jacket, 2 x 20 is the cost of the 2 pairs of shoes, so that is 40 dollars.  Sara needs 30 + 40 = 70 dollars for the jacket and shoes.  She already had 10 dollars.  After babysitting 4 times, she will have 4 x 5 = 20 dollars.  10 + 20 is 30.  So she has 30 dollars.  70 - 30 = 40.  She needs 40 dollars more.  She gets 4 dollars for each time mowing the lawn.  40 / 4 = 10, so she has to mow the lawn 10 times.  The answer is 10. 
 The jacket is $30.  Each pair of shoes is $20.  So the outfit she wants will cost 30 + 2*20 = 30 + 40 = 70.  She already has $10 saved.  After babysitting 4 times, she will make 4*5 = 20 dollars.  So she will have 10 + 20 = 30 dollars.  She still needs 70 - 30 = 40 dollars for the outfit.  She can earn 4 dollars for each lawn she mows.  Therefore, to get 40 dollars, she will have to mow the lawn 40/4 = 10 times.  The answer is 10. 
 Sara has 10 dollars initially.  She gets 5 dollars each time she babysits, 4 times.  So that is 5 * 4 = 20 dollars.  The jacket and shoes combined cost 30 + 2 * 20 = 30 + 40 = 70 dollars.  So she has 10 + 20 = 30 dollars.  To get 30 more dollars, she needs to mow the lawn (and get paid 4 dollars each time) a total of 70 - 30 = 40 dollars.  She earns 4 dollars per mowing.  So she has to mow the lawn 40 / 4 = 10 times.  The answer is 10. 
 Let's first find out how much the jacket and shoes cost.  The jacket costs 30 dollars and 2 pairs of shoes cost 40 dollars (2 x 20 = 40).  30 + 40 = 70. 

 Sara has already 10 dollars.  She also earns 5 dollars 4 times by babysitting.  5 x 4 = 20, so she has 10 + 20 = 30 dollars.  She still needs 70 - 30 = 40 dollars more. 

If she earns 4 dollars each time she mows the lawn, then she needs to mow the lawn 40 / 4 = 10 times to earn enough money.  She can afford the jacket and shoes if she mows the lawn 10 times. 

The answer is 10. 
 Sara wants to buy a jacket that costs $30 and 2 pairs of shoes that cost $20 each.   The total cost will be 30 + 20 + 20 = 70 dollars.   Sara already had 10 dollars saved.  She uses that as a starting point.  She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and $4 for each lawn she mows. 

Let's first calculate how much she earns from babysitting 4 times: 4 x 5 = 20 dollars.  So, she has 10 + 20 = 30 dollars now. 

Now she needs 70 - 30 = 40 dollars more to buy the jacket and shoes.  Each time she mows the lawn, she earns 4 dollars.  To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we can divide the remaining amount needed by the amount she earns each time she mows:

40 / 4 = 10

So Sara must mow the lawn 10 times.  The answer is 10. 
 Sara started with $10.  She earns $5 each time she babysits, so 4 times is 5 * 4 = 20 dollars.  Mowing the lawn gives her 4 dollars each time.  

Jacket costs 30 dollars, and shoes 2 x 20 = 40 dollars, so in total she needs 30 + 40 = 70 dollars.  She currently has 10 + 20 = 30 dollars.  So she is missing 70 - 30 = 40 dollars.  

For each time she mows the lawn, she earns 4 dollars and she needs 40 dollars, so she needs 40/4 = 10 times.  Since she already has 20 dollars, she'll have a total of 30 + 40 = 70 dollars after 2 more times babysitting.  Then she can afford the jacket and shoes. 

The answer is 10. 
1.  First, we find out how many times Sara must babysit to earn enough money for the jacket and shoes.  The jacket costs $30, and the shoes cost $20, so a total of $30 + $20 = $50.  Sara will earn $5 each time she babysits, so she must babysit 50/5 = 10 times.  Since she has already babysat 4 times, she still needs to babysit 10 - 4 = 6 times.  

2.  Now, she needs to figure out how many times she must mow the lawn.  Mowing the lawn earns her $4 each time.  She needs to earn 50 - 10 = 40 more dollars to afford the jacket and shoes.  40 / 4 = 10 times.  

3.  So, she must mow the lawn 10 times to have enough money for the mowing and babysitting.  10 times mowing the lawn will earn her 10 x 4 = 40 dollars.

To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we can divide the remaining amount needed by the amount she earns each time she mows:\n\n40 / 4 = 10\n\nSo Sara must mow the lawn 10 times.  The answer is 10. ", " Sara started with $10.  She earns $5 each time she babysits, so 4 times is 5 * 4 = 20 dollars.  Mowing the lawn gives her 4 dollars each time.  \n\nJacket costs 30 dollars, and shoes 2 x 20 = 40 dollars, so in total she needs 30 + 40 = 70 dollars.  She currently has 10 + 20 = 30 dollars.  So she is missing 70 - 30 = 40 dollars.  \n\nFor each time she mows the lawn, she earns 4 dollars and she needs 40 dollars, so she needs 40/4 = 10 times.  Since she already has 20 dollars, she'll have a total of 30 + 40 = 70 dollars after 2 more times babysitting.  Then she can afford the jacket and shoes. \n\nThe answer is 10. ", '1.  First, we find out how many times Sara must babysit to earn enough money for the jacket and shoes.  The jacket costs $30, and the shoes cost $20, so a total of $30 + $20 = $50.  Sara will earn $5 each time she babysits, so she must babysit 50/5 = 10 times.  Since she has already babysat 4 times, she still needs to babysit 10 - 4 = 6 times.  \n\n2.  Now, she needs to figure out how many times she must mow the lawn.  Mowing the lawn earns her $4 each time.  She needs to earn 50 - 10 = 40 more dollars to afford the jacket and shoes.  40 / 4 = 10 times.  \n\n3.  So, she must mow the lawn 10 times to have enough money for the mowing and babysitting.  10 times mowing the lawn will earn her 10 x 4 = 40 dollars.  \n\nThe answer is 10. ']

 Let's break it down step by step.  Jessa is 20 years old.  Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.  Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.  Now, let's add their ages: 23 + 25 + 20 = 68.  The answer is 68. 
 Jessa is 20 years old.  Joan is 5 years older than Jessa.  So Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.  Mary is 2 years younger than Joan.  So Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.  To find the sum of their ages, add the ages together: 23 + 25 + 20 = 68.  The answer is 68. 
 Let's start with Jessa's age, which is 20. 

Since Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25. 

Since Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23. 

To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, add their individual ages:
20 (Jessa's age) + 25 (Joan's age) + 23 (Mary's age) = 68

The answer is 68. 
 Let's first figure out the age of Joan and Mary:

Jessa is 20 years old. 
Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old. 
Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old. 

Now, let's add up their ages:

20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68

The answer is 68. 
 Let's break it down step by step!

Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is 5 years older than Jessa.  So, Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old. 

Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old. 

To find the sum of the ages, we add up the ages of the three girls:

20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68.  The answer is 68. 
 We need to find the ages of Joan and Mary.  Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is 5 years older, Joan must be 20 + 5 = 25 years old.  Since Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, Mary must be 25 - 2 = 23 years old.  Now we need to add their ages: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.  The answer is 68. 
 Let's work step by step!

Jessa is 20 years old.  Since Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, Joan must be 20 + 5 = 25 years old. 

Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old. 

To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we add their ages together:

20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68

The answer is 68. 
 Let's start by using the information that Jessa is 20 years old.  

Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25. 

Since Mary is two years younger than Joan, Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23. 

Now we can find the sum of their ages: Jessa is 20, Joan is 25, and Mary is 23.  

20 + 25 + 23 = 68

The answer is 68. 
 Let's break it down step by step!

We know that Jessa is 20 years old. 

Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years old. 

Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years old. 

Now, let's find the sum of their ages:
Jessa's age: 20
Joan's age: 25
Mary's age: 23

Adding up their ages, we get: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68

The answer is 68. 
 Since Jessa is 20 years old, Joan is 5 years older which makes her 20 + 5 = 25 years old.  Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, which makes her 25 - 2 = 23 years old.  Adding Jessa's age, Joan's age, and Mary's age gives us 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.  The answer is 68. 
 Let's solve this step by step:

1.  Jessa is 20 years old. 
2.  Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old. 
3.  Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old. 
4.  Now, we need to add their ages together:
20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68.  The answer is 68. 
 First, we find Jessa's sister Joan's age.  If Jessa is 20 and Joan is 5 years older, then Joan is 20 + 5 = 25. 

Then we find Mary's age.  Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23. 

Now we find the sum of their ages.  Jessa is 20 years old, Joan is 25 years old, and Mary is 23 years old.  20 + 25 + 23 = 68.  The answer is 68. 
 To find the age of Mary and Joan, we need to use the information provided. 

First, Jessa is 20 years old.  Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25. 

Now, Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23. 

Now, to find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we add their ages:

Jessa's age: 20
Joan's age: 25
Mary's age: 23

[EXP] 36: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 7, [output]:  There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another.  The difference is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.  The difference is twice the number of fish, so the number of fish is 28 / 2 = 14.  Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the answer is 14 fish in each aquarium. 
32 snails in one aquarium and 4 snails in another aquarium.  The difference is 32 - 4 = 28.  This difference is also twice the number of fish in both aquariums.  So the number of fish in both aquariums is 28 / 2 = 14.  The answer is 14. 
 There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 in the other.  The difference is 32 - 4 = 28.  This is twice the number of fish.  So the number of fish is half of 28, which is 14.  If both aquariums have the same number of fish, then each aquarium has 14 fish.  The answer is 14. 
32 snails - 4 snails = 28 snails in the difference.  The difference is twice the number of fish, so the number of fish is 28 / 2 = 14. 

Since the number of fish is the same in both aquariums, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.  The answer is 14. 
32 - 4 = 28 is the difference between the number of snails.  The difference is twice the number of fish.  So 28 divided by 2 is 14.  If each aquarium has 14 fish, then together they have 14 + 14 = 28 fish.  The answer is 14. 
32 snails - 4 snails = 28 snails.  The difference is 28 snails.  This is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.  Say x is the number of fish in each aquarium.  Then 2x = 28.  x = 28/2 = 14.  So there are 14 fish in each aquarium.  The answer is 14. 
32 - 4 = 28.  That is the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums.  And that is twice the amount of fish, so the amount of fish is 28 / 2 = 14.  Since the aquariums have the same number of fish, the answer is 14. 
 Let's call the number of fish in each aquarium "x".  The total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.  The difference between the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.  This difference is equal to twice the number of fish, so we can set up the equation:
28 = 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:
14 = x

Since there are the same number of fish in each aquarium, the number of fish in each aquarium is also 14. 

The answer is 14. 
 Let's first find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums.  32 (in the second aquarium) - 4 (in the first aquarium) = 28 snails. 

The problem states that the difference in snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums, so let's call the number of fish x.  Then, 2x = 28, and x = 14. 

Since there are the same number of fish in both aquariums, each aquarium has 14 fish.  The answer is 14. 
 Let's first find the difference in the number of snails.  There are 32 snails in one aquarium and 4 snails in the other.  So, the difference is 32 - 4 = 28. 

The problem says that the difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.  Let's represent the number of fish in each aquarium as x.  Then, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x. 

Now, we can set up an equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.  The answer is 14. 
4 snails in one aquarium and 32 in another.  To find the difference, subtract 4 from 32.  32 - 4 = 28.  This difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.  Let's call the number of fish x.  Twice the number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.  Since it is equal to 28, we can set up an equation: 2x = 28.  To solve for x, divide both sides by 2: x = 14.  So there are 14 fish in both aquariums.  The answer is 14. 
 Let's find the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums.  4 (initially in one aquarium) and 32 (initially in the other aquarium) gives 32 - 4 = 28.  This is the difference. 

The difference is also "twice the amount of fish in both aquariums", so we can set up an equation:

28 = 2 x (number of fish)

Divide both sides by 2:

28 / 2 = number of fish

14 = number of fish

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the answer is 14 fish in each aquarium. 
32 - 4 = 28, so the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 28.  The difference is also twice the number of fish.  So, we need to find how many fish for 28 to be equal to 2 times the number of fish. 

Let the number of fish in each aquarium be x. 

The difference in snails is twice the number of fish, which is 2x. 

So, 2x = 28

Divide both sides by 2
x = 14

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

[EXP] 38: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 168, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Andrea has 52 apples, and she has 8 more apples than Jamal.  This means Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples. 

We also know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas. 

Since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. 

In total, Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas.  52 + 24 = 76.  The answer is 76. 
 Let's start with Jamal.  If Andrea has 52 apples and she has 8 more than Jamal, then Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.  Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas. 

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. 

In total, there are 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits.  The answer is 76. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and she has 52 apples.  So Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples. 

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.  So he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas. 

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 ÷ 2 = 24 bananas. 

Adding all the fruits together, Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, which is 52 + 24 = 76 fruits.  The answer is 76. 
 If Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, then Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples. 
Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas. 
Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. 
Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas.  To find the total number of fruits, we add the two numbers together:
52 + 24 = 76
The answer is 76. 
 Firstly, let's find how many apples Jamal has.  Since Andrea has 52 apples and 8 more than Jamal, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples. 

Then, Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.  So, Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas. 

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.  Since Jamal has 48 bananas, Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. 

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas Andrea has.  She has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so the total number of fruits is 52 + 24 = 76.  The answer is 76. 
 First, we will find out how many bananas Jamal has and then we can find out how many bananas Andrea has.  So, Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.  But we do not know how many apples he has.  Since Andrea has 52 apples, that means Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.  

Now we know that Jamal has 44 apples and Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he must have 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.  Since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, Andrea has 48 ÷ 2 = 24 bananas. 

Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, which is 76 fruits.  The answer is 76.

So Mr.  Tan pays a total of 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 dollars in fees.  After paying the loan amount of 250,000, he is left with 400,000 - (32,000 + 250,000) = 400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000.  The answer is 118,000. 
400,000 is the selling price.  The transfer fees are 3% of 400,000, which is 0. 03 x 400,000 = 12,000.  The brokerage fee is 5% of 400,000, which is 0. 05 x 400,000 = 20,000.  In total, the fees are 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000.  Mr.  Tan also paid 250,000 for the remaining loan amount.  So his total outgoings are 32,000 + 250,000 = 282,000.  He gets the selling price minus his outgoings.  400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000.  The answer is 118,000. 
3% of the selling price of $400,000 is $12,000.  5% of the selling price is $20,000.  So the transfer fees and brokerage fees are $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.  The total amount he paid was $250,000 + $32,000 = $282,000.  Mr.  Tan sold the house for $400,000, so his net proceeds are $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.  The answer is 118,000. 
3% of the selling price of 400,000 dollars is 0. 03 x 400,000 = 12,000 dollars.  The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0. 05 x 400,000 = 20,000 dollars.  So the transfer fees and brokerage fees are 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 dollars.  Mr.  Tan gets the money from the sale minus the fees and the loan, which is 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000.  The answer is 118,000.

In total, Mr.  Tan paid 12 000 + 20 000 = 32 000 in transfer fees and brokerage fees.  He also paid 250 000 for the remaining loan amount.  So he paid in total 250 000 + 32 000 = 282 000.

He paid transfer fees that are 3% of the selling price.  3% of $400,000 is 0. 03 x 400,000 = 12,000. 
He also paid a brokerage fee that is 5% of the selling price.  5% of $400,000 is 0. 05 x 400,000 = 20,000. 
Mr.  Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount. 
So in total, he paid 12,000 + 20,000 + 250,000 = 282,000. 
His net proceeds from selling the house is the amount he received minus the amount he paid: 
400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000. 
The answer is 118,000.

So Mr.  Tan paid 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 dollars in fees.  He also paid $250,000 for the loan payment.  In total, he paid 32,000 + 250,000 = 282,000 dollars.  His net proceeds from selling the house will be the selling price minus these expenses.  400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000.  The answer is 118,000. 
 Mr.  Tan sold his house for $400,000.  Transfer fees is 3% of the selling price, so that is 3% of 400,000 = 0. 03 x 400,000 = 12,000 dollars.  Brokerage fees is 5% of the selling price, so that is 5% of 400,000 = 0. 05 x 400,000 = 20,000 dollars.  He also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount.  So in total, Mr.  Tan paid 12,000 + 20,000 + 250,000 = 282,000 dollars.  His net proceeds are the selling price minus the total fees paid, so that is 400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000 dollars.  The answer is 118,000 dollars. 
 Mr.  Tan sold his house for 400,000 dollars.  The transfer fees are 3% of that amount, which is 3% x 400,000 = 0. 03 x 400,000 = 12,000.  The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 5% x 400,000 = 0. 05 x 400,000 = 20,000.  So the total amount of fees he paid is 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 dollars.  He also paid 250,000 for the remaining loan amount, so total amount paid is 32,000 + 250,000 = 282,000.  Thus, his net proceeds from selling the house are 400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000 dollars.  The answer is 118,000. 
3% of the selling price is 3% * 400 000 = 12 000.  So he paid 12 000 in transfer fees. 
A 5% brokerage fee is 5% * 400 000 = 20 000.  So he paid 20 000 in brokerage fees. 
He also paid 250 000 for the remaining loan.  So in total, Mr.  Tan paid 12 000 + 20 000 + 250 000 = 282 000. 
He got 400 000 for the house.  So subtract the amount he paid, 400 000 - 282 000 = 118 000.  The answer is 118 000. 
400 000 is the selling price of the house.  3% of this is 400 000 * 0. 03 = 12 000.  This is the transfer fees.  5% of the price is 400 000 * 0. 05 = 20 000.  This is the brokerage fee.  So Mr.  Tan pays 12 000 + 20 000 = 32 000 dollars in fees.  To find Mr.  Tan's net proceeds, subtract the total fees and remaining loan amount from the selling price.  400 000 - 250 000 - 32 000 = 118 000 dollars.  The answer is 118 000. 
400,000 is the selling price of Mr.  Tan's house.  The transfer fees are 3% of that amount, which will be 400,000 x 0. 03 = 12,000 dollars.  The brokerage fee is 5% of that amount, which will be 400,000 x 0. 05 = 20,000 dollars.  So, the total fees paid will be 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 dollars.  Mr.  Tan still has a remaining loan amount of 250,000 dollars.  So, after subtracting the total fees and the remaining loan amount from the selling price, he will have 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 dollars as his net proceeds.  The answer is 118,000. 
 Let's break down the problem step by step.

[EXP] 40: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 315, [output]: 1800 is the total number of stitches.  The body takes 900 stitches.  The collar takes a tenth of that number, so 900 / 10 = 90.  The rosette takes twice as many as the collar, so 90 * 2 = 180.  So far, 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170.  There are 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches left.  Each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.  The answer is 315. 
1800 is the total number of stitches.  The body takes 900, the collar takes 1/10 of 900 = 90 and the rosette takes 90 x 2 = 180.  So the body + collar + rosette take 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.  Then the sleeves must take 1800 - 1170 = 630.  Since there are 2 sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315.  The answer is 315. 
1800 is the total number of stitches.  The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, the collar takes a tenth of that (10%), and the rosette takes twice as many as the collar.  So the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.  The total number of stitches used by the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.  Therefore, the number of stitches used by each sleeve is 1800 - 1170 = 630 / 2 = 315.  The answer is 315. 
 To begin, the total number of stitches in the sweater is 1800.  We know that the body takes 900 stitches.  The collar takes a tenth of that, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.  The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so the rosette takes 2 x 90 = 180 stitches. 

The total number of stitches in the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170.  That leaves 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches left for the two sleeves.  Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2.  630 / 2 = 315.  The answer is 315. 
1800 stitches is the total number of stitches needed.  The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.  The collar takes 1/10 of that number of stitches, so 900 / 10 = 90.  The rosette takes twice as many as the collar, so 2 * 90 = 180.  So far, we have accounted for 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches, leaving 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches for the two sleeves.  Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches evenly between them, 630 / 2 = 315.  The answer is 315 stitches for each sleeve. 
1800 is the total number of stitches.  900 goes to the body of the sweater.  The collar is a tenth of that, which is 900 ÷ 10 = 90.  The rosette takes twice as many as the collar, which is 90 * 2 = 180.  The total number of stitches for the rest of the sweater is the sum of the body, collar, and rosette.  That is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170.  1800 - 1170 = 630.  This means 630 stitches go towards the two sleeves.  Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve must have 630 ÷ 2 = 315 stitches.  The answer is 315. 
900 = body stitches, so 1800 - 900 = 900 stitches are left.  The collar takes a tenth of the body, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.  The rosette takes 2 times the collar, or 2 x 90 = 180 stitches.  That leaves 900 - (90 + 180) = 630 stitches.  Since there are two sleeves and one left for the body and the other pieces, each sleeve must take 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.  The answer is 315. 
1800 is the total number of stitches required for the whole sweater.  The body of the sweater is 900 stitches.  The collar is one-tenth of the body, so it is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.  The rosette is twice the collar, so it is 90 x 2 = 180 stitches.  Add all the stitches together, 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170.  This is the total number of stitches left for the two sleeves, which is 1800 - 1170 = 630.  Since the two sleeves are the same size, we divide the 630 stitches by 2 to get the number of stitches each sleeve takes, which is 315.  The answer is 315.

The answer is 6. 
2 tubs of ice cream will cost 2 x (11 - 13) = 2 x 2 = 4 dollars less.  A packet of milk costs 0. 5 dollars less.  4 packets of milk will be 4 x 0. 5 = 2 dollars less.  So in total, you will save 4 + 2 = 6 dollars.  The answer is 6.

1 tub of ice cream is sold at a discount of 13 - 11 = 2 dollars.  So buying 2 tubs of ice cream is a discount of 2 x 2 = 4 dollars. 

A packet of milk is sold at a discount of 0. 5 dollars.  Buying 4 packets of milk is a discount of 0. 5 x 4 = 2 dollars. 

In total, buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk will be a discount of 4 + 2 = 6 dollars.  The answer is 6. 
2 tubs of ice cream at a discount of $2 each ($13 - $11 = $2) will be 2 x 2 = 4 dollars saved.  Each packet of milk is $0. 5 cheaper, so 4 packets will be 4 x 0. 5 = 2 dollars saved.  So in total, you will save 4 + 2 = 6 dollars.  The answer is 6. 
 The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x (13 - 2) = 2 x 11 = 22 dollars.  The cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 x (1 - 0. 5) = 4 x 0. 5 = 2 dollars.  The total cost is 22 + 2 = 24 dollars.  Originally, the cost would be 2 x 13 + 4 x 1 = 26 + 4 = 30 dollars.  The saving will be 30 - 24 = 6 dollars.  The answer is 6. 
1 tub of ice cream is discounted from $13 to $11, so the discount is $2.  For 2 tubs, the discount is $4. 

A packet of milk is discounted by $0. 5, so for 4 packets, the discount is $2. 

Total discount = $4 (for 2 tubs of ice cream) + $2 (for 4 packets of milk) = $6

The answer is 6. 
2 tubs of ice cream will save 13 - 11 = 2 dollars each, so it will save 2 x 2 = 4 dollars in total.  4 packets of milk were sold at a discount of $0. 5 each, so it will save 0. 5 x 4 = 2 dollars.  In total, you will save 4 + 2 = 6 dollars.  The answer is 6. 
2 tubs of ice cream will cost 2 x $2 = $4 less.  Since each tub originally costs $2 more, you will save 2 x $2 = $4.  4 packets of milk will cost 4 x $0. 5 = $2 less.  So you will save a total of $4 + $2 = $6.  The answer is 6. 
1 tub of ice cream goes from 13 to 11, so the discount is 13 - 11 = 2 dollars.  If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, you will save 2 * 2 = 4 dollars.  Each packet of milk is discounted by 0. 5 dollars, and since you buy 4 packets, you will save 0. 5 * 4 = 2 dollars.  In total, you will save 4 + 2 = 6 dollars.  The answer is 6. 
2 tubs of ice cream at a discount of $13 to $11 will be a saving of $2 per tub.  For two tubs, the saving will be 2 x $2 = $4. 

4 packets of milk at a discount of $0. 5 will be a saving of $0. 5 x 4 = $2. 

The total saving will be $4 + $2 = $6.  The answer is 6. 
13 - 11 = 2 dollars saved on each tub of ice cream.  So for 2 tubs, you will save 2 x 2 = 4 dollars.  There are 4 packets of milk and each is 0. 5 dollar.  So you will save 0. 5 x 4 = 2 dollars.  In total, you will save 4 + 2 = 6 dollars.  The answer is 6. 
1 tub of ice cream costs $13 but now costs $11, so you will save $13 - $11 = $2 on each tub.  You are buying 2 tubs, so you will save 2 x $2 = $4.  Now, a packet of milk is sold at a discount of $0. 5, so you will save $0. 5 on each packet.  You are buying 4 packets of milk, so you will save 4 x $0. 5 = $2.  You will save $4 on the ice cream and $2 on the milk, for a total of $4 + $2 = $6.  The answer is 6. 
1 tub of ice cream will cost $11, so 2 tubs will cost 2 x $11 = $22.  Originally, the tub of ice cream cost $13, so you will save 2 x ($13 - $11) = 2 x $2 = $4 on 2 tubs of ice cream. 

A packet of milk is sold at a discount of $0. 5, so the cost of 4 packets will be 4 x ($0. 5) = $2. 

In total, you will save $4 (from the tubs of ice cream) + $2 (from the packets of milk) = $6.  The answer is 6. 
2 tubs of ice cream will save 2 * (13 - 11) = 2 * 2 = 4 dollars.  Milk packets are $0. 5 each, so 4 packets will cost 4 * 0. 5 = 2 dollars.  
The total cost saved is 4 dollars (for the ice cream) + 2 dollars (for the milk) = 6 dollars.  The answer is 6. 
 Let's start with the price of the tub of ice cream.  It's originally $13, but now it's $11, so you will save $13 - $11 = $2 per tub of ice cream.  Since you're buying 2 tubs, you will save $2 x 2 = $4. 

The packet of milk is originally $0 (not provided in the question, but since it's not equal to the original price, it must be a discount), and the discount is $0. 5.  So, you will save $0. 5 per packet of milk.  Since you're buying 4 packets, you will save $0. 5 x 4 = $2. 

In total, you will save $4 + $2 = $6.  The answer is 6.

[EXP] 46: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]: 2 families with 6 people are 2 x 6 = 12 people.  3 families with 4 people are 3 x 4 = 12 people.  So in total, Martha invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.  8 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 of 8 = 2 people had previous commitments.  So 8 + 2 = 10 people were unable to attend.  24 - 10 = 14 people showed up for Martha's party.  The answer is 14. 
 Martha invited 2 families with 6 people, so that is 2 * 6 = 12 people.  Then she invited 3 families with 4 people, so that is 3 * 4 = 12 people.  In total, she invited 12 + 12 = 24 people. 

Then 8 people couldn't come due to illness, so 24 - 8 = 16 people are left. 

1/4 of 8 is 2 people who had previous commitments, so 16 - 2 = 14 people are left. 

The answer is 14. 
2 families with 6 people each means 2 x 6 = 12 people.  3 families with 4 people each means 3 x 4 = 12 people.  In total, 12 + 12 = 24 people were invited.  8 people couldn't come due to illness.  Then 1/4 of that number, which is 8 / 4 = 2, had previous commitments and didn't come.  So 8 + 2 = 10 people didn't come.  24 - 10 = 14 people show up.  The answer is 14. 
2 families with 6 people = 2 x 6 = 12 people
3 families with 4 people = 3 x 4 = 12 people
In total, Martha invited 12 + 12 = 24 people

8 people couldn't come due to illness, so we subtract 8 from the total: 24 - 8 = 16

And 1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, so we subtract 1/4 of 8: 8 / 4 = 2
16 - 2 = 14

The answer is 14. 
2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people is a total of (2 x 6) + (3 x 4) = 12 + 12 = 24 people.  However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness, so that leaves 24 - 8 = 16 people left.  1/4 of 8 is 2, so 2 people had previous commitments.  So 16 - 2 = 14 people show up for Martha's party.  The answer is 14. 
2 families with 6 people each will be 2 x 6 = 12 people.  3 families with 4 people each will be 3 x 4 = 12 people.  In total, Martha invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.  After 8 people couldn't come due to illness and 1/4 that number (8/4 = 2) had previous commitments, 8 + 2 = 10 people are not attending.  24 - 10 = 14 people show up for Martha's party.  The answer is 14. 
 Martha invited 2 families with 6 people.  That's a total of 2 x 6 = 12 people.  Then she invited 3 families with 4 people.  That's a total of 3 x 4 = 12 people.  In total, she invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.  8 people couldn't come due to illness, so we subtract 8 from 24: 24 - 8 = 16.  1/4 of 8 is 8 / 4 = 2.  So 2 people had previous commitments.  We subtract 2 more from 16: 16 - 2 = 14.  The answer is 14. 
 Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that is 2 * 6 = 12 people.  She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that is 3 * 4 = 12 people.  In total, she invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.  8 people couldn't come, so 8 are subtracted from the total.  1/4 of 8 people had prior commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2.  So we subtract 2 more from the total.  24 - 8 - 2 = 14.  The answer is 14. 
2 families with 6 people is 2 x 6 = 12 people.  3 families with 4 people is 3 x 4 = 12 people.  So in total there are 12 + 12 = 24 people invited.  Subtract the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness: 24 - 8 = 16 people.  Then subtract 1/4 that number which had previous commitments (1/4 of 8 is 2, so subtract 2 people): 16 - 2 = 14.  The answer is 14. 
6 people x 2 families = 12.  4 people x 3 families = 12.  So, there were originally 12 + 12 = 24 people invited.  8 people couldn't come due to illness.  1/4 of 8 people is 8/4 = 2, who had previous commitments.  So, 8 + 2 = 10 people couldn't come.  There were 24 invited and 10 couldn't come, so 24 - 10 = 14 people attended the party.  The answer is 14. 
 Let's break it down step by step.  Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 people.  She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 more people.  In total, Martha invited 12 + 12 = 24 people. 

8 people couldn't come due to illness, so subtract 8 from the total invitees: 24 - 8 = 16. 

1/4 that number had previous commitments, which is 1/4 x 8 = 2 people.  Subtract those from the remaining 16 invitees: 16 - 2 = 14. 

The answer is 14 people show up for Martha's party. 
2 families with 6 people each, that's 2 * 6 = 12.  3 families with 4 people each, that's 3 * 4 = 12.  In total, there were 12 + 12 = 24 people invited.  8 people couldn't come due to illness.  1/4 of 8 people is 8 / 4 = 2.  So 2 people had previous commitments.  8 + 2 is 10.  So 10 people didn't come to the party.  If 24 people were invited and 10 didn't come, then 24 - 10 = 14 people show up for Martha's party.  The answer is 14. 
2 families with 6 people is 2 * 6 = 12 people.  3 families with 4 people is 3 * 4 = 12 people.  So in total, Martha invited 12 + 12 = 24 people. 
But 8 people couldn't come due to illness.  1/4 of that number means 8 / 4 = 2 people had previous commitments.  So, 8 + 2 = 10 people couldn't come. 
24 invited people - 10 who couldn't come = 24 - 10 = 14 people show up for Martha's party. 
The answer is 14. 
 Martha invited 2 families with 6 people, and 3 families with 4 people, which means she invited 2 * 6 + 3 * 4 = 12 + 12 = 24 people.  Unfortunately, 8 people couldn't come due to illness.  So 24 - 8 = 16 people are left.  1/4 of 8 is 2, meaning another 2 people couldn't come due to previous commitments.  Therefore, 16 - 2 = 14 people will show up.  The answer is 14. 
 Martha invited 2 families with 6 people, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 people.  She invited 3 families with 4 people, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 more people.  In total, that's 12 + 12 = 24 people invited.  However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness.  So we subtract 8 from the total number of invited people to get 24 - 8 = 16 people remaining.  Out of the 8 people who couldn't come, 1/4 of that number (8 / 4 = 2) had previous commitments, so we subtract 2 from the remaining number to get 16 - 2 = 14 people left.  The answer is 14. 
 Martha invited 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people.  How many people did Martha invite? 2 x 6 = 12, 3 x 4 = 12.  In total, she invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.  8 people could not come due to illness.  Then there are 8 / 4 = 2 people who had previous commitments.  So, originally 24 people were invited.  24 - 8 - 2 = 14.  The answer is 14. 
2 families with 6 people will invite 2 x 6 = 12 people to the party, and 3 families with 4 people will invite 3 x 4 = 12 people to the party.  So a total of 12 + 12 = 24 people were invited.  Because 8 people couldn't come due to illness, there were 24 - 8 = 16 people who didn't come.  1/4 of 8 is 2, so 2 people had previous commitments.  2 people didn't come who already were invited, leaving 16 - 2 = 14 people.  The answer is 14. 
 Let's calculate the number of people Martha invited first.  She invited 2 families with 6 people each.  That's 6 x 2 = 12 people.  Then, she invited 3 families with 4 people each.  That's 4 x 3 = 12 people.  In total, she invited 12 + 12 = 24 people. 

There are 8 people who couldn't come due to illness.  That's 8 people who won't be coming to the party.  Then, 1/4 of that number had previous commitments, which is (1/4) x 8 = 2 people.  So, a total of 8 + 2 = 10 people won't be attending the party.  

To find the number of people who will show up, subtract the number of people who won't attend from the total number of people invited: 24 - 10 = 14. 

The answer is 14.

[EXP] 47: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Jam has a total of 26 pencils.  26 pencils are 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so each box has 26 - 2 = 24 / 3 = 8 pencils.  Meg has 46 pencils.  In total, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.  72 pencils in total can be 72 / 8 = 9 boxes.  The answer is 9. 
 Jam has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils.  To find out how many pencils per box, we can subtract the loose pencils from the total and divide by the number of boxes.  26 - 2 = 24.  24 / 3 is 8.  So each box has 8 pencils. 

Jam and Meg have a total of 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.  To find out how many boxes they need, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box.  72 / 8 = 9.  So they need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.  The answer is 9. 
 Jam has a total of 26 pencils.  This includes 3 boxes plus the 2 loose pencils, so 3 boxes is 26 - 2 = 24 pencils.  This means each box has 24 / 3 = 8 pencils.  Together, Jam and Meg have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.  To put all these pencils in boxes, each holding 8 pencils, we divide 72 by 8.  72 / 8 is 9.  The answer is 9. 
 Jam has three boxes full of pencils, so that's 3 boxes x some amount.  She also has 2 loose pencils.  So she has 3 boxes + 2 loose pencils = 26 pencils in total.  To find out how many pencils in each box, we do 26 - 2 = 24.  Then 24 pencils/box.  So each box has 24/3 = 8 pencils. 

Jam and Meg together have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.  Each box has 8 pencils, so they need 72/8 = 9 boxes.  The answer is 9. 
 Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils.  Each box contains an unknown number of pencils.  Let's call this number x.  So 3 boxes will contain 3x pencils.  She also has 2 loose pencils, so in total, Jam has 3x + 2 pencils.  We know that this total is 26, so we can set up the equation 3x + 2 = 26.  Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get 3x = 24.  Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 8.  So each box contains 8 pencils.  To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together, we add the total number of pencils Jam has to the total number of pencils Meg has: 3x + 2 + 46 = 3(8) + 2 + 46 = 24 + 2 + 46 = 26 + 46 = 72.  So Jam and Meg need a box to store each 8 pencils.  To store all 72 pencils, they will need 72 / 8 = 9 boxes.  The answer is 9. 
 Jam has 26 pencils in all, with 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils.  So each box has 26 / 3 = 8. 786.  = 8 pencils (ignoring the decimal for simplicity).  So Jam has 3 boxes.  Meg has 46 pencils.  If they combine their pencils, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.  So they need to combine their pencils into 72 / 8 = 9 boxes.  Therefore, they need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.  The answer is 9. 
 Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so in total she has 3 x ? + 2 = 26 pencils.  We need to find out what number of pencils is in each box.  Let's say the number is x, then we get the equation 3x + 2 = 26.  Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us 3x = 24.  Dividing both sides by 3 gives us x = 8. 

So each box contains 8 pencils.  Jam has 3 boxes, so she has 3 x 8 = 24 pencils in her boxes.  She also has 2 loose pencils, so in total she has 24 + 2 = 26 pencils.  Meg has 46 pencils. 

To find out how many total boxes we need, we need to add Jam's and Meg's pencils: 24 + 46 = 70.  Each box has 8 pencils, so we divide 70 by 8 to get 8. 75.  Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to 9 boxes. 

The answer is 9. 
 Jam has 3 boxes with an unknown number of pencils in each box.  With 2 loose pencils, she has 26 pencils in total.  Since there are 2 loose pencils, each box has the same amount of pencils, so we can divide 26 - 2 by 3 (the number of boxes) to get 8 pencils per box.  This means 3 boxes full of pencils are 8 x 3 = 24 pencils.  24 + 2 loose pencils is 26.  So the number of pencils in each box is 8. 

Meg has 46 pencils. 

So in total, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils. 

Each box has 8 pencils, so we need to divide 72 by 8 to get the number of boxes needed.  72 / 8 = 9. 

The answer is 9. 
 Jam starts with 3 boxes of pencils.  Each box contains an unknown number of pencils, but in total, there are 26 pencils.  So if we subtract the loose pencils from the total, we get the number of pencils in each box: 26 - 2 = 24.  Since each box contains the same number of pencils, we divide 24 by 3: 24 / 3 = 8. 

So each box contains 8 pencils and there are 3 boxes, which makes a total of 3 x 8 = 24 pencils.  To add the 2 loose pencils, the total number of pencils Jam has is 24 + 2 = 26. 

Meg has 46 pencils. 

To find the total number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, add the number of pencils Jam and Meg have: 26 + 46 = 72.  Then, divide the total by the number of pencils in each box: 72 / 8 = 9. 

The answer is 9. 
 Jam has 3boxes with pencils and 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 3 boxes + 2 loose pencils = 3 + 2 = 5.  This gives 5 boxes worth of pencils, since each box has an unknown number of pencils, we will represent this as 5x.  But we know that the total number of pencils is 26, so we can write:

3x + 2 = 26

To solve this equation, we subtract 2 from both sides:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Then we divide both sides by 3:

x = 24/3
x = 8

So each box has 8 pencils.  Jam and Meg have a total of 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.  Each box has 8 pencils, so we can divide the total number of pencils by 8 to find the number of boxes needed:

72/8 = 9

So Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.  The answer is 9. 
 Jam started with 26 pencils.  26 pencils is 3 boxes full of pencils plus 2 loose pencils.  The number of pencils in a box is 26 - 2 = 24.  To find the number of pencils per box, 24/3 = 8.  So each box contains 8 pencils. 

Jam has 26 pencils, out of which 24 are in 3 boxes.  Therefore, 2 pencils are loose.  Meg has 46 pencils. 

For both Jam and Meg, we have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.  Each box contains 8 pencils.  To find out how many boxes they need, we divide 72 by 8: 72/8 = 9. 

So, both Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.  The answer is 9. 
 Jam has a total of 26 pencils.  This is the sum of the 3 boxes and the 2 loose pencils.  If she has 2 loose pencils, then each box must have 26 - 2 = 24 / 3 = 8 pencils.  So each box has 8 pencils. 

Meg has 46 pencils.  So the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have is 26 + 46 = 72. 

Each box has 8 pencils and each has 3 boxes, so Jam needs 3 boxes originally.  Meg has 46 pencils, and that is already 46 / 8 = 5. 75 boxes.  But we can't have half a box, so Meg needs to have 6 boxes. 

So in total, 3 + 6 boxes are needed.  3 + 6 = 9.  The answer is 9. 
 Jam started with 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which make a total of 26 pencils.  To find the number of pencils per box, we subtract the loose pencils from the total:
26 - 2 = 24
24 pencils are in 3 boxes.  To find the number of pencils in one box, we divide 24 by 3:
24 ÷ 3 = 8
Each box contains 8 pencils. 
Jam has 3 boxes, which means each box contains 8 pencils.  

So, if we compute the total number of pencils Jam has:
8 pencils per box × 3 boxes = 24 pencils
Adding the 2 loose pencils, Jam has 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. 
Meg has 46 pencils. 

To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have:
26 pencils (Jam) + 46 pencils (Meg) = 72 pencils

Now, we find the number of boxes they need:
8 pencils per box (from Jam's boxes) × ? boxes = 72 pencils (total)

To find the number of boxes needed for Meg's pencils:
72 pencils (total) ÷ 8 pencils per box = 9 boxes

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.  The answer is 9. 
 Jam had 2 loose pencils.  She had 3 boxes full of pencils, so we need to find out how many pencils are in each box.  If there are a total of 26 pencils, we can set up an equation:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box.  To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Then, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So each box has 8 pencils.  Jam has 3 boxes, so she has a total of 3x = 3*8 = 24 pencils in her boxes.  Now, if you add the 2 loose pencils, she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. 

Meg has 46 pencils.  Together, Jam and Meg have a total of 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.  If we add the number of pencils in Jam's boxes and the loose pencils together, we see that:

 Jam's boxes: 24 pencils
 Loose pencils: 2 pencils
 Total Jam's pencils: 24 + 2 = 26 pencils


 Meg's pencils: 46 pencils


 Total Jam and Meg's pencils: 26 + 46 = 72 pencils

Since there are 8 pencils in each box, Meg needs 46 / 8 = 5. 75 boxes (not whole box).  So, Meg needs 6 boxes (rounded up). 

Jam needs 3 boxes. 

In total, Jam and Meg need 3 + 6 = 9 boxes. 

The answer is 9.

[EXP] 49: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 72, [output]: 8 shares for 8 dollars each is a total of 8 x 8 = 64 dollars.  The price increases 50% the first year.  64 x 1. 5 = 96.  So the shares are now worth 96 dollars.  Then it decreases 25% in the second year.  96 x 0. 75 = 72.  The answer is 72. 
 Maria originally bought 8 shares at 8 dollars each, so that's a total of 8 x 8 = 64 dollars.  The stock price increases by 50%, so the new price is 8 * 1. 5 = 12 dollars.  So the value of the 8 shares is now 8 x 12 = 96 dollars.  Then the price decreases by 25%, so the new price is 12 * 0. 75 = 9 dollars.  The value of the 8 shares is now 8 x 9 = 72 dollars.  So the final value of all Maria's shares is 72 dollars.  The answer is 72. 
8 shares are bought for 8 dollars each, so the initial value of Maria's shares is:
8 x 8 = 64

The stock price increases by 50%, so the new price is:
8 * 1. 5 = 12

So the value of Maria's shares is:
8 x 12 = 96

Then, the stock price decreases by 25%, so the new price is:
12 * 0. 75 = 9

So the value of Maria's shares is:
96 * 0. 75 = 72

The answer is 72. 
 Maria bought 8 shares for 8 dollars each, so she spent 8 * 8 = 64 dollars.  The price increases 50% the first year, so the price becomes 8 * 1. 5 = 12 dollars per share.  For 8 shares, this is 12 * 8 = 96 dollars.  But the price then decreases 25% in the second year, so the price becomes 12 * 0. 75 = 9 dollars per share.  For 8 shares, this is 9 * 8 = 72 dollars.  The total value of all Maria's shares is 72 dollars.  The answer is 72. 
 Maria starts by buying 8 shares for 8 dollars each, so she spends 8 x 8 = 64 dollars.  After 1 year, the stock price increases 50%, so the value of each share becomes 8 x (1 + 0. 5) = 12 dollars.  The value of all 8 shares becomes 8 x 12 = 96 dollars.  The next year, the stock price decreases 25%.  So each share is now worth 12 x (1 - 0. 25) = 9 dollars.  The value of all 8 shares becomes 8 x 9 = 72 dollars.  The answer is 72. 
8 shares for $8 each will cost Maria 8 x 8 = 64 dollars.  The first year the stock price increases 50%, so the price becomes 1. 5 x 8 = 12.  So each share is now worth 12 dollars.  Since Maria has 8 shares, their total value becomes 8 x 12 = 96 dollars.  The next year, the stock price decreases 25%, so the price becomes 0. 75 x 12 = 9 dollars.  Each share is now worth 9 dollars.  So the total value of Maria's shares becomes 8 x 9 = 72 dollars.  The answer is 72. 
 Maria started with 8 shares at $8 each.  The total value of shares Maria owns is 8 * 8 = 64 dollars. 

The first year, the stock price increases 50%, which is (64 * 1. 5) = 96 dollars. 

The second year, the stock price decreases 25%, which is (96 * 0. 75) = 72 dollars. 

The answer is 72. 
8 shares for 8 dollars each will cost $64.  After a 50% increase, each share is worth $8 * 1. 5 = $12, and so the total value is 8 * 12 = $96.  After losing 25%, each share is now worth $9, and the total value is 8 * 9 = $72.  The answer is 72. 
 Maria had 8 shares and bought each share for 8 dollars.  So the total cost was 8 x 8 = 64 dollars.  The stock price increased by 50%.  This means the price of each share is now 8 x 1. 5 = 12 dollars.  The total value of the shares is then 8 x 12 = 96.  Then the price decreases by 25%.  This means the price of each share is now 12 x 0. 75 = 9 dollars.  The total value of the shares is then 8 x 9 = 72.  The answer is 72. 
 Maria started with 8 shares of a stock, each costing $8.  That's a total of 8 x 8 = 64.  The stock price increases by 50% the first year, so the new price is $8 + (8 x 0. 5) = $12.  Maria now has 8 x $12 = $96 worth of stocks.  The next year, the price decreases by 25%, so the new price is $12 - (12 x 0. 25) = $9.  The value of Maria's stocks is now 8 x $9 = $72.  The answer is 72. 
8 shares times 8 dollars each is 64 dollars.  When the stock price increases by 50%, the value of each share is now 8 * 1. 5 = 12 dollars.  With 8 shares at this value, Maria has 12 * 8 = 96 dollars.  The price then decreases by 25% so each share is now 12 * 0. 75 = 9 dollars.  With 8 shares at this value, Maria has 9 * 8 = 72 dollars.  The answer is 72. 
 Maria starts with 8 shares of stock that cost $8 each, so she has a total value of 8 * 8 = 64 dollars. 

The first year, the stock price increases 50%, so the price per share increases by half of the original price: 8 * 0. 5 = 4.  The new price is 8 + 4 = 12 dollars per share.  The total value of Maria's shares after the first year is 8 * 12 = 96 dollars. 

The second year, the stock price decreases 25%, so the price per share decreases by a quarter of the current price: 12 * 0. 25 = 3.  The new price is 12 - 3 = 9 dollars per share.  The total value of Maria's shares after the second year is 8 * 9 = 72 dollars. 

The answer is 72. 
8 shares of a stock for $8 each will cost Maria 8 x 8 = 64 dollars.  When the price increases by 50%, each share increases to 1. 5 x 8 = 12 dollars.  Total value of shares becomes 8 x 12 = 96 dollars.  
Then, when the price decreases by 25%, the price becomes 12 x 0. 75 = 9 dollars.  
Total value of shares becomes 96 x 0. 75 = 72 dollars.  The answer is 72. 
 Maria originally bought 8 shares for $8 each.  So, she paid a total of 8 * 8 = 64 dollars. 

After the stock price increases 50% the first year, the value of each share becomes 1. 5 * 8 = 12 dollars. 

The total value then becomes 8 * 12 = 96 dollars. 

Finally, the stock price decreases 25% in the second year.  This means the value of each share becomes 0. 75 * 12 = 9 dollars. 

The total value of all shares is now 8 * 9 = 72 dollars. 

The answer is 72 dollars. 
 Maria starts with 8 shares at 8 dollars each, so she has 8 * 8 = 64 dollars.  The stock price increases by 50%.  50% of 64 is 0. 5 * 64 = 32.  So the new price becomes 64 + 32 = 96.  96 is 25% less than the value after the increase.  25% of 96 is 0. 25 * 96 = 24.  So the value of the stock after the price decrease is 96 - 24 = 72.  The answer is 72. 
 Maria started with 8 shares of the stock, and each share cost 8 dollars, so Maria had a total of 8 x 8 = 64 dollars worth of stock.  

After the stock price increased by 50%, the new price is 8 * 1. 5 = 12.  So the value of Maria's shares increased from 64 to 8 x 12 = 96 dollars. 

However, then the stock price decreased by 25%, so the new price is 12 * 0. 75 = 9 dollars.  The value of Maria's shares decreased from 96 dollars to 8 * 9 = 72 dollars. 

The answer is 72. 
 Maria started with 8 shares of stock for $8 each.  So, her initial investment is 8 x 8 = 64 dollars.  After the price increases 50%, the stock price is now increased to $12.  So the value of her shares is now 12 x 8 = 96 dollars.  Then the price decreases 25%, so Maria's shares are now worth 12 x 0. 75 = 9 dollars.  The value of her shares is now 9 x 8 = 72 dollars.  The answer is 72. 
8 shares for $8 each is a total cost of 8 x 8 dollars = 64 dollars.  The stock price increases by 50% the first year.  An increase of 50% on 8 dollars is an increase of 4 dollars.  The price of each share is now 8 + 4 = 12 dollars.  Then, the price decreases by 25% in the second year.  A decrease of 25% on 12 dollars is a decrease of 3 dollars.  The price of each share is now 12 - 3 = 9 dollars.  8 shares multiplied by 9 dollars each is 8 x 9 = 72.  Maria's 8 shares are now worth 72 dollars.  The answer is 72. 
 Maria starts with 8 shares at 8 dollars each, so she has a total of 8 x 8 = 64 dollars.  After the first year, the price goes up 50%, so each share is worth 1. 5 times its original value.  8 x 1. 5 is 12, so each share is worth 12 dollars.  To get the total value, we multiply 8 shares by 12 dollars each, which is 8 x 12 = 96 dollars. 

Then, the second year, the price decreases 25%, so each share is worth 0. 75 times its value.  Since each share is worth 12 dollars, each share is now worth 12 x 0. 75 = 9 dollars.  To get the total value, we multiply 8 shares by 9 dollars each, which is 8 x 9 = 72 dollars. 

So, the final total value of Maria's shares is 72 dollars.  The answer is 72. 
 Maria starts with 8 shares priced at $8 each, so she initially spends 8 x 8 = 64 dollars. 
The first year, the stock increases 50% in value, so each share becomes $8 x 1. 5 = $12. 
Maria now has 8 shares at a price of $12 each, so their total value is 8 x 12 = 96 dollars. 
The second year, the stock decreases 25% in value, so each share becomes 12 x 0. 75 = $9. 
Maria's total value is now 8 x 9 dollars, or 72 dollars. 
The answer is 72. 
 Maria started with 8 shares of stock, each costing 8 dollars, so she spent a total of 8 x 8 = 64 dollars for the shares.  After a 50% increase, the price becomes 12 dollars (8 x 1. 5).  So the total value of her 8 shares is 8 x 12 = 96.  Then, a 25% decrease is a 25% drop from the new price, which is a 3 dollar drop.  So the new price is 12 - 3 = 9 dollars.  The value of 8 shares at this price is 8 x 9 = 72.  The answer is 72. 
 Maria originally bought 8 shares at $8 each.  This means she spent 8 x 8 = 64 dollars.  After the stock price increases by 50%, then the new stock price is 1. 5 (1 + 0. 5) times the original stock price.  So the new price is 8 x 1. 5 = 12 dollars. 

So the total value of Maria's shares is 12 x 8 = 96 dollars.  Then the stock price decreases by 25%, so it becomes 1 - 0. 25 = 0. 75 times the current price.  So the new price is 12 x 0. 75 = 9 dollars.  The total value of Maria's shares at this point is 9 x 8 = 72 dollars.

[EXP] 52: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Morgan's dad said she has 90 dollars.  

A round of mini-golf is 5 dollars, and she wants to play once, so that is 1 x 5 = 5 dollars spent on mini-golf.  

She also wants 5 dollars in arcade tokens, which is 5 dollars.  

And she wants to ride the go-karts twice, which is 10 x 2 = 20 dollars spent on go-karts.  

So in total, she spent 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 dollars.  

After spending, she has 90 - 30 = 60 dollars left.  

Since each friend will cost 5 dollars (mini-golf) + 5 dollars (arcade tokens) + 10 dollars (two go-karts), it will be 20 dollars per friend.  

60 / 20 = 3.  The answer is 3. 
 Morgan's dad says she has 90 dollars for her birthday party.  First, she wants to play 1 round of mini-golf for each person.  Then, she wants to give everyone 5 dollars in arcade tokens.  And finally, she wants to ride the go-karts twice for each person.  So, first, let's calculate the total cost.  1 round of mini-golf for each person is 5 dollars.  So for X friends, it will be 5X dollars.  She also wants to give 5 dollars in arcade tokens for each friend.  So that is 5X dollars more.  And she wants to ride the go-karts twice for each friend.  Since each ride is 10 dollars, for both rides it is 10 * 2 = 20 dollars.  For all the friends, it will be 20X dollars.  So we have 5X + 5X + 20X = the total cost.  This simplifies to 30X.  We know the total budget is 90 dollars, so 30X = 90.  To find X, we can divide both sides by 30.  So X = 90 / 30.  X is 3.  This means she can invite 3 friends to her birthday party.  The answer is 3.

[EXP] 54: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step!

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. 

The next day, they sold double that number: 14 x 2 = 28 pairs. 

On the last day, they sold one-half of the amount they sold the day before: 28 ÷ 2 = 14 pairs. 

However, 6 people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total: 14 - 6 = 8 pairs. 

In total, the store sold: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs of tennis shoes. 

The answer is 50. 
 The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes on Friday.  On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 14 x 2 = 28.  On the last day, they sold half of 28, which is 28 / 2 = 14.  However, six people returned their shoes, so they actually sold 14 - 6 = 8 pairs of shoes.  So in total, they sold 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs.  The answer is 50. 
 On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.  Then on Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 14 x 2 = 28 pairs of shoes.  On Sunday, they sold half of 28, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs of shoes.  Now, 6 people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so the total number of shoes sold is 14 + 28 + 14 - 6 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

On Friday, they sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. 

The next day, they sold double that number, which is 14 x 2 = 28 pairs of tennis shoes. 

On the last day, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs of tennis shoes. 

But, six people returned their pairs, so the total sold is reduced by 6.  14 - 6 = 8. 

To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we add 14 + 28 + 8 = 50. 

The answer is 50. 
 On the first day, 14 pairs of shoes were sold.  The next day, the store sold double that amount, so 14 x 2 = 28.  On the last day, they sold half the amount of the previous day, so 28 / 2 = 14.  However, 6 people returned their pairs, so they sold 14 - 6 = 8.  In total, 14 + 28 + 8 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. 

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 14 x 2 = 28 pairs. 

On Sunday, they sold half of what they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. 

However, 6 people returned their shoes because they didn't fit.  We need to subtract those 6 from the total sold on Sunday. 

So, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is:

14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returns) = 50

The answer is 50. 
14 pairs were sold on Friday.  The next day, they sold double that number.  So 2 x 14 = 28 pairs were sold on saturday.  On the last day, they sold half of 28, which is 28 / 2 = 14.  But 6 people returned their shoes, so subtract 6 from 14, which is 14 - 6 = 8.  The total number of shoes sold is 14 + 28 + 8 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
 The shoe store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes on Friday.  On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 14 x 2 = 28.  On Sunday, they sold half the number of shoes they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14.  However, 6 shoes were returned because they didn't fit, so we need to subtract 6 from 14.  14 - 6 is 8.  So on Sunday, they sold 8 pairs of shoes.  In total, they sold 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs of shoes.  The answer is 50. 
14 pairs of tennis shoes were sold on Friday.  Next day they sold double that, which is 2 x 14 = 28 pairs.  On the last day, they sold half of that, which is 28/2 = 14 pairs, but 6 people returned their pairs.  So, they actually sold 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.  Altogether, they sold 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs.  The answer is 50. 
 The shoe store started by selling 14 pairs on Friday.  The next day, they sold double that, or 14 * 2 = 28 pairs.  On the last day, they sold half the amount as the day before, which would be 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.  However, 6 people returned their shoes, so 14 - 6 = 8 pairs were sold on the last day.  In total, 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs were sold.  The answer is 50. 
14 pairs were sold on Friday.  On the next day, they sold double that, which is 14 x 2 = 28.  On the last day, they sold half of what they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14.  However, 6 people returned their pairs, so the store had 14 - 6 = 8 pairs unsold.  So the total sold is 14 + 28 + 8 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 

Friday, they sold 14 pairs of shoes. 
Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 14 x 2 = 28 pairs of shoes. 
Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs of shoes.  However, 6 people returned their shoes, so 14 - 6 = 8 pairs of shoes were sold on Sunday. 

To get the total number of shoes sold, we add the numbers sold each day: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50. 

The answer is 50. 
14 pairs of tennis shoes were sold on Friday.  Then they sold 2 * 14 = 28 tennis shoes on Saturday.  On the last day, they sold half of what they did the day before, so 28/2 = 14.  However, 6 people returned their pairs, so the number of pairs sold that day is 14 - 6 = 8.  In total, 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 tennis shoes were sold.  The answer is 50. 
 On Friday the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.  On Saturday, they sold double that number of shoes, which is 14 x 2 = 28.  On Sunday, they sold half of the day before (28 ÷ 2 = 14) but six people returned their pairs, so the total sold on Sunday was 14 - 6 = 8.  In total, 14 + 28 + 8 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
14 pairs were sold on friday.  On saturday, twice as many pairs were sold, which would be 2 * 14 = 28.  On sunday, half as many pairs were sold as on saturday, which is 0. 5 * 28 = 14.  But six people returned their pairs on sunday, so the store only sold 14 - 6 = 8 pairs on sunday.  In total, the store sold 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs of tennis shoes.  The answer is 50. 
 The store originally sold 14 pairs on friday.  Then they sold double that amount on saturday, which would be 14 * 2 = 28 pairs.  On sunday, they sold 28 / 2 = 14 pairs, but 6 people returned shoes, so that is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs sold.  In total, that's 14 + 28 + 8 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
 On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. 
On Saturday, the store sold double that number of shoes, so that's 2 * 14 = 28 shoes. 
On Sunday, the store sold half the amount that they did on Saturday, so that's 28 / 2 = 14 shoes. 
Adding up the number of shoes sold, we get: 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 shoes. 
However, six people returned their shoes, so we need to subtract 6 from the total: 56 - 6 = 50
The answer is 50. 
 On Friday, 14 pairs of shoes were sold.  

The next day, double that number were sold, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs. 

On the third day, they sold half the amount from the previous day, but 6 shoes were returned.  Half of 28 is 14, and subtract 6 from that is 14 - 6 = 8.  

So, the total shoes sold are 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 shoes.  The answer is 50. 
14 pairs of shoes were sold on Friday.  The next day, double that amount was sold, which is 14 x 2 = 28 pairs.  28 pairs were sold on Saturday, so for Saturday and Friday, 14 + 28 = 42 pairs of shoes were sold.  On the last day, they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.  6 people returned their shoes, so the actual number of shoes sold on the last day is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

52 members, 50% boys, 50% girls means 52 / 2 = 26 boys and 26 girls.  Performing only with female members means 26 girls.  Half the people performing can't make it, which is half of 26, or 13.  So 26 - 13 = 13 girls can still perform.  Adding the 3 teachers, the total number of people singing in the performance is 13 + 3 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
50% of the choir are boys, and 50% are girls.  So there are 52 / 2 = 26 girls in the choir.  When the choir decides to perform with just its female members, there are 26 girls.

Then 3 teachers join in, so there are 13 + 3 = 16 people in the performance.  The answer is 16. 
52 is the total number of choir members.  Half of the members are boys and half are girls.  Half of 52 is 52 / 2 = 26.  So 26 are boys and 26 are girls.  Since they are performing with only females, there are 26 girls.  On the day of the performance, half the people can't make it.  Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.  So 13 can't make it and 26 - 13 = 13 can make it.  The 3 teachers join in, so the total number of people singing in the performance is 13 + 3 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
50% of 52 is 52 / 2 = 26.  So there are 26 boys and 26 girls in the choir.  After the female members perform, half of them can't make it to the show, so 26 / 2 = 13 of the female members can't make it.  They started with 26 female members, and 13 can't make it, so 26 - 13 = 13 female members are left.  The 3 teachers also join the performance.  So there are 13 + 3 = 16 people singing in the performance.  The answer is 16. 
52 members total, 50% boys and 50% girls, means 26 girls and 26 boys.  Then, only female members will perform, so 26 girls will perform.  Half of them can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down, so that's 26/2 = 13.  So 26 - 13 = 13 girls will perform.  Then, the 3 teachers join in, so that's 13 + 3 = 16.  The answer is 16.

52 members in the choir are 50% girls and 50% boys, which is the same as 26 girls and 26 boys.  The choir decides to only have the girls perform.  So, there are 26 girls performing.  Half of the 26 girls can't make it due to the bus breakdown, so that's 26/2 = 13 girls who can't make it, which leaves 26 - 13 = 13 girls performing.

50% of the choir members are girls.  This can be written as a decimal: 0. 5.  0. 5 times 52 is 26, so there are 26 girls in the choir.  But then half of the girls (26 / 2 = 13) can't make it to the show, so there are 26 - 13 = 13 girls performing.

52 people are in the choir.  Half are boys and half are girls, which means 52/2 = 26 girls.  The choir decides to perform with only the girls, so it has 26 girls.  Half of those girls, 26/2 = 13, cannot make it to the show.  So there are 26 - 13 = 13 girls performing.  If the 3 teachers sing with the girls, there are a total of 13 + 3 = 16 people singing.  The answer is 16. 
 Let's break this down step by step:

1.  52 members in the choir, 50% boys and 50% girls.  Since 50% = 0. 5, there are 0. 5 x 52 = 26 boys and 26 girls. 
2.  The choir performs with just its female members, so the number of female members singing is 26. 
3.  Half of those performing (26) can't make it, so 26 / 2 = 13 members can't make it.  That leaves 26 - 13 = 13 female members singing. 
4.  The 3 teachers also sing with the remaining 13 female members, so the total number of people singing is 13 + 3 = 16. 

The answer is 16. 
50% of the choir is 50/100 of 52 = 26.  That means 26 are boys and 26 are girls, so 52 - 26 = 26 girls performed initially.  Half of the people can't make it, so 26/2 = 13 cannot make it.  That leaves 26 - 13 = 13 girls left.  Since 3 teachers also join, the total number of singers is 13 + 3 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
52 members are in the choir.  50% are boys and 50% are girls.  So we can say 52 * 0. 5 = 26 are boys and 52 * 0. 5 = 26 are girls.  After only keeping the girls, they have 26 girls.  Then half the 26 girls can't make it.  26 / 2 is 13, so 13 girls can't make it.  26 - 13 = 13 girls make it to the performance.  3 teachers join.  So 13 + 3 = 16 people sang in the performance.  The answer is 16. 
50% of the choir members are boys, so 50% are girls.  50% of 52 is 26 (52 * 0. 5 = 26), so there are 26 girls.  The choir only chooses the girls, so there are 26 girls singing.  Then, half of them can't show up because of the bus breakdown.  That means 26 / 2 = 13 girls can't show up, so 26 - 13 = 13 girls show up to sing.  Then, the 3 teachers join them, so in total, there are 13 + 3 = 16 singers.  The answer is 16. 
52 members are in the choir.  50% of 52 is 52 / 2 = 26.  So 26 are boys and 26 are girls.  Since the performance is only for girls, there are 26 female members.  50% of them can't make it because their bus breaks down, so that's 26 / 2 = 13.  So there are 26 - 13 = 13 girls left to perform.  The choir's 3 teachers are singing too, so 3 more singers.  In total, 13 + 3 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
52 members are in the choir.  50% are boys and 50% are girls.  That means 26 boys and 26 girls are in the choir.  The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so it's just the 26 girls.  
Half of the 26 girls can't make it because their bus breaks down, so that's 26/2 = 13 girls who won't perform.  
So there are 26 - 13 = 13 girls left to perform.  
Plus the 3 teachers, there are 13 + 3 = 16 people in total.  The answer is 16. 
52 members are part of the choir.  50% are boys, so the number of boys is 50% of 52, which is 26 boys.  The number of girls is the remaining 52 - 26 = 26.  

For the performance, they decided to go with just the female members, which is 26. 

On the day of the performance, half of 26 girls, which is 13, couldn't make it because their bus broke down.  So 26 - 13 = 13 girls are left. 

But then, 3 teachers decided to join.  So the total number of people on stage is 13 + 3 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
52 members in the choir.  50% are boys, so 52 * . 5 = 26 boys.  That means 52 - 26 = 26 girls.  Thus, originally 26 girls were going to perform. 

The show's performance was reduced by half due to the bus breaking down.  26/2 is 13.  So, only 13 girls were left to perform. 

The 3 teachers added to the group to make it 13 + 3 = 16. 

The answer is 16. 
50% of 52 members are boys, so the number of boys is 0. 5 * 52 = 26.  50% are girls, so the number of girls is 0. 5 * 52 = 26.  Originally, there are 26 + 26 = 52 members, but they decide to perform with just the female members, which are 26 girls. 

Then, half of those 26 girls can't make it because their bus breaks down.   So, 1/2 of 26 = 13 girls cannot perform.  That leaves 26 - 13 = 13 girls who can perform. 

The 3 teachers also join the performance.  So the total number of people singing is 13 + 3 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
52 members in the choir, 50% of which are boys and 50% of which are girls.  Since 50% is the same as 1/2, half the choir is boys and half is girls.  So half of 52 is 26 boys and 26 girls.  The choir decides to perform with just its female members.  26 girls sang initially. 

On the day of the performance, half the people can't make it because the bus breaks down.  The half that can't make it is 13 girls, because 26 / 2 = 13.  So 13 girls can't make it, and 26 - 13 = 13 girls can make it. 

Then, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them.  They add 3 teachers to the 13 girls, so the total number of people who sang is 13 + 3 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
52 members originally, of which 50% are boys and 50% are girls.  Therefore, 52 x 0. 5 = 26 girls, and 52 - 26 = 26 boys.  To consider just the female members, there are 26 girls.  However, half of them, or 26 / 2 = 13, couldn't make it to the performance.  So, 26 - 13 = 13 girls can sing in the performance.  Then, we have to add the 3 teachers.  So, the total singers are: 13 + 3 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
50% of the choir is girls.  To find the number of girls, multiply 50% by the total number of choir members: 0. 5 x 52 = 26 girls.  If the choir decides to perform with just female members, that means there are 26 people. 
On the day of the performance, half the people can't make it, which means half of the 26 girls can't make it.  
Half of 26 is 13.  So 13 girls can't make it.  
That leaves 26 - 13 = 13 girls who can make it. 

The choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them.  They, too, will become part of the performance.  
Therefore, there were 13 + 3 = 16 people who sang in the performance.  The answer is 16.

For Hulu and Disney Plus, he would normally pay 10 dollars each, so that is 20 dollars.  But since he is bundling, he saves 20% of 20 dollars, which is 0. 2 * 20 = 4 dollars.  So instead of 20, he pays 20 - 4 = 16 dollars for the two services.  So he saves 60 - (10 + 16) = 60 - 26 = 34 dollars.  The answer is 34. 
60 dollars a month for the cable.  He pays 10 for Netflix.  Instead of paying 10 for Hulu and 10 for Disney Plus, he only pays (10 + 10) * 0. 8 (1 - 0. 20 discount) = 16 for both.  So that's a savings of 60 - (10 + 16) = 60 - 26 = 34.  The answer is 34. 
 First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services.  Netflix is 10 dollars.  Hulu and Disney Plus each originally costs 10 dollars, but he saves 20%, which means he pays 80% of the original cost.  80% of 10 is 8.  So the total cost is 10 + 8 + 8 = 26 dollars.  He had a 60 dollar cable package.  So by switching to streaming, he saves 60 - 26 = 34.  The answer is 34. 
 First, the monthly cost of the streaming services: Netflix for 10 dollars, Hulu and Disney Plus for 20% off of 10 per month each (20% of 10 is 2, so they will be 8 per month each, for a total of 10 + 8 + 8 = 26).   The cable package costs 60 dollars per month.   The difference between the cost of streaming and cable is 60 - 26 = 34 dollars.  The answer is 34. 
 Tim originally pays 60 dollars for his cable subscription.  He will be paying for Netflix (10) and 2 other streaming services (Hulu and Disney Plus).

 Since Erica is 30 years old, Beth is 5 years older than her, so Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old.  Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old.  The difference in their ages is 42 - 30 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
 Let's work backwards:

Erica is 30 years old. 
Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old. 
Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old. 

Now, let's find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica:
42 - 30 = 12

The answer is 12. 
 Let's start by using the information that Erica is 30 years old and Beth is 5 years older than Erica.  This means Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old. 

We are also told that Alice is 7 years older than Beth.  So Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old. 

Now we want to find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica.  To do this, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age: 42 - 30 = 12. 

The answer is 12. 
 Since Erica is 30, Beth is 5 years older so Beth is 35.  Alice is 7 years older than Beth so Alice is 42.  The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12.  

The answer is 12. 
 First, we figure out how old Beth and Alice are.  Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica and Erica is 30 years old, Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old.  Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old.  The difference between their ages is 42 - 30 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
 Let's start with Erica.  Since Erica is 30 years old, Beth is 30 + 5 = 35.  Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice is 35 + 7 = 42.  The difference in their ages is 42 - 30 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
 First, we need to find the age of Beth.  Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, who is 30 years old, Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old.  Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old.  To find the difference between their ages, we subtract the age of Erica (30) from the age of Alice (42): 42 - 30 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
 Let's start with Erica, who is 30 years old.  Since Beth is 5 years older, Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35 years old.  Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice's age is 35 + 7 = 42 years old.  

To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, subtract Erica's age from Alice's age.  42 - 30 is 12.  The answer is 12. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 

Erica's age is 30. 

Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35. 

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 35 + 7 = 42. 

Now, we need to find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica. 

Age of Alice - Age of Erica = 42 - 30 = 12. 

So, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12.  The answer is 12. 
 Let's start by using Beth's age to set up an equation: Beth = Erica + 5. 

Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we know that Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35. 

Now we know that Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so we can set up another equation: Alice = Beth + 7. 

Alice = 35 + 7 = 42. 

To find the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age: Alice - Erica = 42 - 30 = 12.

Only 5% of the candles that will explode will also smell like wet dog.  0. 05 x 500 = 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode. 

The answer is 25. 
99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode.  1% will explode.  That means 50000 x 1% = 500 candles will explode. 

Of those candles, 5% will also smell like wet dog.  5% of 500 is 25, so 25 of the 500 exploding candles will also smell like wet dog. 

The answer is 25. 
1% of the candles do not have the guarantee not to explode.  5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.  So the percentage of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog is 1% * 5% = 0. 05%. 

We multiply the total number of candles by 0. 05% to get the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog. 

50000 x 0. 05% = 50000 x 0. 0005 = 25

The answer is 25 candles. 
5% of the candles smell like wet dog and 1% of the candles will explode.  To find the intersection of these two, first find 1% of 50,000, which is 500.  Then find 5% of 50,000, which is 2,500.  So, the candles that both have a defect of smelling like a wet dog and exploding is 1% of 5% of 50,000, which is 1/100 * 2,500 = 25.  The answer is 25. 
5% of 50000 is 50000 * (5/100) = 2500 candles that have the defect and smell like wet dog.  1% of 50000 is 50000 * (1/100) = 500 candles that may explode.  The problem asks for the intersection of these two events: candles that both explode and smell like wet dog.  Since the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, we can assume that 1% will explode, but only the ones with the defect will also smell like wet dog.  So the intersection of these two events is 2500 * (1/100) = 25.  The answer is 25.

[EXP] 63: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 1% of 5 dollars is 0. 01 x 5 = 0. 05 dollars.  So, George spent 5 - 0. 05 = 4. 95 dollars on the bags of chips and candy bars.  The total cost of the 3 bags of chips is 3 x 0. 40 = 1. 20.  So, George spent 4. 95 - 1. 20 = 3. 75 dollars on candy bars.  Since each candy bar costs 0. 75 dollars, he bought 3. 75 / 0. 75 = 5 candy bars.  The answer is 5. 
5 dollars is equal to 500 cents.  After spending some money, he had 1% money left.  1% of 500 cents is 5 cents.  So he spent 495 cents.  He also bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, which is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.  495 - 120 = 375 cents for candy bars.  The cost of a candy bar is 75 cents, so the number of candy bars is 375 / 75 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
 Let's first convert $5 to cents, since the prices are in cents.  $5 is equal to 500 cents.  

George had 500 cents and spent a part of it and had 1% left.  1% of 500 is 5 cents.  So he spent 500 - 5 = 495 cents. 

He bought 3 bags of chips, which is 3 x 40 = 120 cents.  

He spent 120 cents on chips, so he has 495 - 120 = 375 cents left.  

He spent the remaining 375 cents on candy bars.  Each candy bar is 75 cents, so 375/75 = 5.  He bought 5 candy bars.  

The answer is 5. 
40 cents for a bag of chips.  Let's figure out how much he spends on chips. 
George spent 3 * 40 cents = 120 cents on chips.  In dollars, this is 1. 2 dollars. 

George started with 5 dollars and had 1% of his money left.  1% of 5 is 0. 05 dollars. 

After spending 1. 2 dollars on chips, he has 5 - 1. 2 = 3. 8 dollars left. 

George spent the remaining money on candy bars.  Let's convert his remaining money to cents: 3. 8 * 100 = 380 cents. 

Each candy bar costs 75 cents.  So he bought 380 cents / 75 cents = 5 candy bars. 

The answer is 5 candy bars. 
 First, we need to convert the money George spent to cents.  $5 = 500 cents.  He had 1 percent of his money left, so he spent 100 - 1 = 99 percent of his money.  In cents, that is 500 * 0. 99 = 495 cents. 

Then, he spent 495 cents on chips and candy bars.  The bag of chips costs 40 cents.  The total cost of 3 bags of chips is 40 * 3 = 120 cents.  He spent 495 cents, and 120 cents were spent on chips.  So, he spent 495 - 120 = 375 cents on candy bars. 

The cost of a candy bar is 75 cents, so he bought 375 / 75 = 5 candy bars.  The answer is 5. 
5 dollars were spent.  We know that after buying chips for 40 cents each, George had 1% of the original 5 dollars left, which means he spent 99% of it, or 0. 99 * 5 = 4. 9 dollars.  He must have spent $4. 9 - 3 * 0. 40 = $4. 3 on candy bars.  Now we know he spent 4. 3 dollars on candy bars.  4. 3 / 0. 75 = 5. 73.

Now, let's find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:

Margareth has 140 beads and Elizabeth has 60 beads, so Margareth has 140 - 60 = 80 more beads. 

The answer is 80. 
1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads is a total of 1 + 2 = 3 packs.  Each pack has 20 beads.  So Elizabeth has 3 * 20 = 60 beads.  Margareth has 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads, which is 3 + 4 = 7 packs.  So she has 7 * 20 = 140 beads.  To find the difference between Margareth and Elizabeth, we do 140 - 60 = 80.

 First, we find out how many beads each sister bought.  Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear, so she bought a total of 1 + 2 = 3 packs of beads.  Each pack has 20 pieces, so Elizabeth bought 3 x 20 = 60 pieces of beads.  Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red, so she bought a total of 3 + 4 = 7 packs of beads.  Margareth also bought 7 x 20 = 140 pieces of beads.  To find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract 60 from 140.  140 - 60 is 80.  The answer is 80. 
 Elizabeth bought 1 + 2 = 3 packs of beads.  Each pack has 20 pieces, so Elizabeth has 20 x 3 = 60 beads.  Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red, which is a total of 3 + 4 = 7 packs.

To find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract: 140 - 60 = 80.  The answer is 80. 
 We know that Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads.  1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear means 1 + 2 = 3 packs.  Each pack has 20 beads, so Elizabeth has 20 x 3 = 60 beads. 

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red.  3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red means 3 + 4 = 7 packs.  Each pack has 20 beads, so Margareth has 20 x 7 = 140 beads. 

Elizabeth has 60 beads and Margareth has 140 beads.  To find out how many more beads Margareth has, we subtract Elizabeth's beads from Margareth's beads: 140 - 60 = 80.  The answer is 80. 
 Elizabeth bought 1 + 2 = 3 packs of beads.  Each pack had 20 beads, so she had 3 * 20 = 60 beads.  

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red.  She bought 3 + 4 = 7 packs in total.  Similarly, each pack had 20 beads, so she bought 7 * 20 = 140 beads. 

To find out how many more beads Margareth has, subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 140 - 60 = 80.  The answer is 80.

Let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought:

Elizabeth: 1 pack of red beads = 20 beads.  2 packs of clear beads = 20 x 2 = 40 beads.  In total, Elizabeth bought 20 + 40 = 60 beads. 

Margareth: 3 packs of blue beads = 20 x 3 = 60 beads.  4 packs of red beads = 20 x 4 = 80 beads.  In total, Margareth bought 60 + 80 = 140 beads. 

To find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:

Margareth has 140 beads - Elizabeth has 60 beads = 80 beads more. 

The answer is 80. 
 Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads.  1 pack of red beads contains 20 beads, so she has 20 beads from the red pan.  2 packs of clear beads also contains 2 * 20 = 40 beads.  In total, Elizabeth has 20 + 40 = 60 beads. 

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads.  3 packs of blue beads contains 3 * 20 = 60 beads.  4 packs of red beads also contains 4 * 20 = 80 beads.  In total, Margareth has 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

[EXP] 65: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 539, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

The salesman bought the case of 48 sneakers for $576.  He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each during the flash sale, so he made:

17 x 20 = 340 dollars

He has 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.  He sold the rest to the department store for $25 each.  So, he made:

31 x 25 = 775 dollars

In total, he made 340 + 775 = 1115 dollars. 

He spent 576 dollars on the sneakers, so his profit is:

1115 - 576 = 539 dollars

The answer is 539. 
 The salesman spent 576 dollars to buy the sneakers.  For 17 sneakers sold at 20 dollars each, the salesman received 17 x 20 = 340 dollars.  For the remaining 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers, the salesman sold them for 31 x 25 = 775 dollars.  In total, the salesman received 340 + 775 = 1115 dollars.

 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576.  So the cost of the sneakers is $576. 

He sold 17 sneakers for $20 at a flash sale on Monday, which gives him a revenue of $340 (17 x $20).  This means he has $340 - $240 = $100 profit from the flash sale. 

The rest of the sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) were sold to a department store for $25 each.  The total revenue from these sales is 31 x $25 = $775.  

The total revenue from all the sales is $340 + $775 = $1115.  Since the cost of the sneakers was $576, the total profit is $1115 - $576 = $539. 

The answer is 539. 
48 sneakers in the case were originally purchased for 576 dollars.  The salesman sold 17 sneakers at 20 dollars each, which is 20 * 17 = 340 dollars.  After selling the rest of the sneakers, there are 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.  31 sneakers at 25 dollars each is 25 * 31 = 775 dollars.  In total, he got 340 + 775 = 1115 dollars from the sales.  Since he paid 576 dollars for the case, his profit is 1115 - 576 = 539 dollars.  The answer is 539. 
 The salesman started with a total cost of $576.  He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so he made 17 x 20 = $340.  He also sold the rest of the sneakers for $25 each, and he sold the rest of the sneakers that were not sold in the flash sale.  There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.  They were sold for $25 each, so he made 31 x 25 = $775.  The total amount he made was 340 + 775 = 1115 dollars.  The total cost was $576, so the profit is 1115 - 576 = 539 dollars.  The answer is 539. 
48 sneakers cost $576.  So the cost per sneaker is $576 / 48 = $12.  The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, which makes $20 * 17 = $340.  48 - 17 = 31 sneakers are left.  These sneakers are sold for 31 * $25 = $775 at a department store.  The salesman makes a total of $775 + $340 = $1115 from selling the sneakers.  Since the cost was $576, the profit is $1115 - $576 = $539.  The answer is 539. 
48 sneakers for 576 dollars originally.  Then he sold 17 for 20 dollars each.  That's 17 x 20 = 340.  So he made a revenue of 340 dollars from the flash sale.  There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.  Those 31 sneakers were sold for $25 each, so he made 31 x 25 = 775.  His total revenue is 340 + 775 = 1115.  The total cost of the original 48 sneakers was 576.  So his profit is 1115 - 576 = 539.  The answer is 539. 
 The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for 576 dollars.  After selling 17, he has \frac{48-17}{1} = 31 left.  The 17 sneakers he sold at 20 dollars each were worth 17 * 20 = 340 dollars.  The remaining 31 sneakers were sold for 25 dollars each.  31 * 25 = 775.  So the total money the salesman made was 340 + 775 = 1115.  He originally spent 576 dollars, so his profit was 1115 - 576 = 539.  The answer is 539. 
576 dollars was the price of the case, for 48 sneakers.  He sold 17 on monday for 20 dollars each.  So he got 20 x 17 = 340 dollars for the 17 sneakers.  The remaining 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers were sold at 25 each.  31 x 25 = 775 dollars.  The total is 340 + 775 = 1115.  The salesman spent 576 dollars.  Profit is 1115 - 576 = 539.  The answer is 539. 
 Let's start by calculating the number of sneakers he sold at the flash sale.  He sold 17 sneakers at $20 each, so he earned 20 * 17 = 340 dollars from the sale. 

He had 48 sneakers initially.  After selling 17 sneakers, he had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left. 

He sold the rest of the sneakers to the department store at $25 each.  So, he sold 31 sneakers at $25 each and earned 25 * 31 = 775 dollars. 

Total money earned = 340 + 775 = 1115 dollars. 

The cost of the sneakers was 576 dollars.  So, the profit = 1115 - 576 = 539 dollars. 

The answer is 539. 
iring the same approach as before, we can break this problem down step by step. 

The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.  He sold 17 of them for $20 each.  The total amount of money he earned from the flash sale is:

17 sneakers x $20 each = $340

The salesman then sold the rest of the sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) to a department store for $25 each.  The total amount of money he earned from this sale is:

31 sneakers x $25 each = $775

The salesman's total income is the sum of the two amounts: $340 + $775 = $1115

The salesman's cost was $576 for the original purchase of the sneakers.  To find his profit, subtract his cost from his income:

$1115 (income) - $576 (cost) = $539

The answer is 539. 
 We know that the salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576.  So, the cost per sneakers is 576 / 48 = 12 dollars.  

At the flash sale on Monday, the salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so he made 17 x 20 = 340 dollars.  The cost of those 17 sneakers was 17 * 12 = 204 dollars.  So, the profit from the sale was 340 - 204 = 136 dollars. 

For the rest of the week, the salesman sold the rest of the sneakers to the department store for $25 each.  There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, so he made 31 * 25 = 775 dollars.  The cost of those sneakers was 31 * 12 = 372 dollars.  So, the profit from those sales was 775 - 372 = 403 dollars. 

The total profit from all the sales is the sum of the profit from the flash sale and the profit from the department store sales: 136 + 403 = 539 dollars.  

The answer is 539. 
 The salesman had 48 sneakers at the beginning.  Then he sold 17 at a flash sale for $20 each, which would be 20 * 17 = 340.  He got $576 for the case, and then $340 at the sale, so he had spent $576 - $340 = $236.  After selling the remaining 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers to the department store for $25 each, he got 31 * 25 = 775.  In total, he made $775 after spending $236, so the profit would be 775 - 236 = 539.  The answer is 539. 
 Let's first find out how much money the seller got from the sale:

17 sneakers for 20 dollars each is 17 x 20 = 340 dollars

The seller had a case of 48 sneakers, so he has 48 - 17 = 31 left. 

The remaining 31 sneakers were sold for 25 dollars each.  So, 31 x 25 = 775 dollars. 

The seller paid $576 for the case of 48 sneakers, so the profit is:
Profit = Total sold - Total cost
= (340 + 775) - 576
= 1115 - 576
= 539
The answer is 539.

[EXP] 73: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 7 dollars in total were spent.  1 pack of grape cost 2 dollars and 1 pack of green apple cost half of that, which is 1 dollar.  So 2 + 1 = 3 dollars were spent on those two.  So the 2 packs of strawberry gum cost 7 - 3 = 4 dollars.  Since there are 2 packs, each pack of strawberry gum costs 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2. 
7 dollars in total were paid.  2 dollars for the grape gum and 0. 5 * 2 = 1 dollar for the green apple gum.  The last 7 - (2 + 1) = 7 - 3 = 4 dollars were spent on the strawberry gum.  The strawberry gum came in packs, and 2 packs were bought.  So each pack of strawberry gum cost 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2. 
 Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.  She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum and 1 pack of grape gum.  She paid half as much for the green apple gum as she did for the grape gum.  So, the green apple gum must have cost $1.  She spent $2 on the grape gum, so the two strawberry gum will cost $7 - $2 - $1 = $4.  Then, each strawberry gum will cost $4 / 2 = $2.  The answer is 2. 
 Suzie paid 7 dollars in all.  She paid 2 dollars for a pack of grape gum and half as much for the green apple gum, so she spent 2 / 2 = 1 dollar on the green apple gum.  That means the packs of strawberry gum, which she bought 2, cost 7 - 2 - 1 = 4 dollars.  Since she bought 2 packs, each pack of strawberry gum cost 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2. 
7 dollars in total.  2 packs of grape = 2 dollars.  1 small pack of green apple = 1 dollar.  That means 2 + 1 = 3 dollars.  Since Suzie bought 4 packs, she has 7 - 3 = 4 dollars left.  Since she bought 2 packs of strawberry, each pack of strawberry must have cost 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2. 
 Suzie got 4 packs of gum.  2 of them were strawberry packs.  So the remaining 2 packs were not strawberry.  The 2 packs that were not strawberry were the grape and the green apple packs.  The grape pack cost 2 dollars, and the green apple pack cost half of that, which is 1 dollar.  So the 2 non-strawberry packs cost 2 + 1 = 3 dollars.  7 dollars total minus 3 dollars is 4 dollars.  4 dollars was spent on the 2 strawberry packs, so 4/2 = 2.  The answer is 2. 
 Let's start by listing the information given: Suzie bought 4 packs of gum, 2 of her favorite flavor (strawberry), 1 pack of grape gum ($2), and 1 small pack of green apple gum (half the cost of grape gum, so $1).  She paid $7 in total. 

Let's first find the cost of the green apple gum: since it's half the cost of the grape gum, it's $1.  Then, we have the total cost of all the packs of gum: $2 (grape) + $1 (green apple) + (2 x ?) (strawberry).  The total cost is $7, so we set up the equation:

$2 + $1 + (2 x ?) = $7

Subtract $3 from both sides:

2 x ? = $4

Divide both sides by 2:

? = $2

So each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.  The answer is 2. 
 Suzie bought 4 packs of gum.  2 were strawberry gum, 1 was grape gum, and 1 was green apple gum.  2 packs of strawberry gum.  1 pack of grape gum for $2.  1 pack of green apple gum for half as much as grape gum.  So pack of green apple gum cost 2/2 = 1 dollars.  Now, total cost is 2 strawberry packs + 1 grape pack + 1 green apple pack = 7 dollars.  So, 2 strawberry packs cost 7 - 1 - 2 = 4 dollars.  1 strawberry pack cost 4/2 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2. 
 Let's start by identifying the values we know.  Suzie bought 4 packs of gum.  2 packs were strawberry, 1 was grape, and 1 was green apple. 

Let's first find the total cost of the strawberry gum.  We know that Suzie paid a total of $7 and that the green apple gum cost half as much as the grape gum.  So, the green apple cost $1.  The grape gum cost twice as much as the green apple, so it cost $2.  Now we know that the strawberry gum must have cost a total of $7 - $3 = $4.  Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, each pack cost $4 / 2 = $2.  The answer is 2. 
4 packs in total were bought.  1 pack of grape costs $2, 1 pack of green apple costs half of $2 (which is $1) and 2 packs are strawberry.  So, $2 + $1 + (price of 2 packs of strawberry) = $7.  Let's call the price of each pack of strawberry x.  Since 2 packs of strawberry cost 2x, then 2x + $2 + $1 = $7.  Then, 2x + 3 = 7.  Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get 2x = 4.  Dividing by 2, we get x = 2.  So each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.  The answer is 2. 
 Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total: 2 packs of strawberry gum and 1 pack of grape gum and 1 pack of green apple gum.  She paid a total of 7 dollars. 

Let x be the cost of a pack of strawberry gum.  Then the cost of the strawberry gum packs is 2x, the cost of the grape gum pack is 2 dollars, and the cost of the green apple gum pack is x/2 (since it's half the price). 

The total cost is the sum of these, or 2x + 2 + x/2.  This equals 7, so 2x + 2 + x/2 = 7.  We can combine the x's and simplify the equation to get:

2. 5x + 2 = 7

Subtract 2 from both sides:

2. 5x = 5

Divide by 2. 5:

x = 2

So each pack of strawberry gum costs 2 dollars.  The answer is 2. 
7 dollars were paid.  We don't know how much each strawberry pack costs yet.  One pack of grape gum cost 2 dollars.  The small pack of green apple gum is half the price of the grape gum, which is 1 dollar.  The total cost of these three packs of gum is 2 + 1 + cost of two packs of strawberry gum.  This equals 7.  We need to find out the cost of two packs of strawberry gum.  Let's call the cost x.  Then, the equation is 2 + 1 + 2x = 7.  Now, subtract 3 from both sides, to get 2x = 4.  Now, divide both sides by 2, to get x = 2.  So each pack of strawberry gum costs 2 dollars.  The answer is 2.

', '7 dollars in total.  2 packs of grape = 2 dollars.  1 small pack of green apple = 1 dollar.  That means 2 + 1 = 3 dollars.  Since Suzie bought 4 packs, she has 7 - 3 = 4 dollars left.

She paid $7 in total. \n\nLet's first find the cost of the green apple gum: since it's half the cost of the grape gum, it's $1.  Then, we have the total cost of all the packs of gum: $2 (grape) + $1 (green apple) + (2 x ?) (strawberry).  The total cost is $7, so we set up the equation:\n\n$2 + $1 + (2 x ?) = $7\n\nSubtract $3 from both sides:\n\n2 x ? = $4\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n? = $2\n\nSo each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

So pack of green apple gum cost 2/2 = 1 dollars.  Now, total cost is 2 strawberry packs + 1 grape pack + 1 green apple pack = 7 dollars.  So, 2 strawberry packs cost 7 - 1 - 2 = 4 dollars.  1 strawberry pack cost 4/2 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2. ', " Let's start by identifying the values we know.

We know that Suzie paid a total of $7 and that the green apple gum cost half as much as the grape gum.  So, the green apple cost $1.  The grape gum cost twice as much as the green apple, so it cost $2.  Now we know that the strawberry gum must have cost a total of $7 - $3 = $4.  Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, each pack cost $4 / 2 = $2.  The answer is 2.

Let's call the price of each pack of strawberry x.  Since 2 packs of strawberry cost 2x, then 2x + $2 + $1 = $7.  Then, 2x + 3 = 7.  Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get 2x = 4.

He uses 3/5 of 80 to buy dinner.  3/5 of 80 is 3/5 * 80 = 48.  After buying dinner, he is left with 80 - 48 dollars.  80 - 48 is 32.  The answer is 32. 
 Ali has 4 * 10 + 6 * 20 = 40 + 120 = 160 dollars.  He gives half his money to his sister.  160 / 2 = 80.  So he gives 80 dollars to his sister.  He has 160 - 80 = 80 dollars left.  He uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner.  3/5 of 80 = 48.  So he uses 48 dollars for dinner.  He will have 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left after buying the dinner.  The answer is 32. 
 Let's first calculate the total amount of money Ali has.  He has 4 x 10 = 40 dollars in 10-dollar bills and 6 x 20 = 120 dollars in 20-dollar bills.  The total amount of money he has is 40 + 120 = 160 dollars.  Then, he gives half of the amount to his sister.  Half of 160 is 160/2 = 80 dollars.  So he gives 80 dollars to his sister and has 160 - 80 = 80 dollars left.  He then uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner.  3/5 of 80 is 48, so he uses 48 dollars to buy dinner.  He has 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left.  The answer is 32. 
 Ali has 4 * 10 = 40 dollars from the 10 dollar bills and 6 * 20 = 120 dollars from the 20 dollar bills.  So he has a total of 40 + 120 = 160 dollars.  

Then, he gives his sister half of the money, which is 160/2 = 80 dollars.  He has 160 - 80 = 80 dollars left. 

After that, he uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner, which is 3/5 * 80 = 48 dollars.  So, he bought dinner with 48 dollars and has 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left.  

The answer is 32. 
10x4 = 40
20x6 = 120
40+120 = 160
After giving half of the total money to his sister, he would give 160/2 = 80. 
He would be left with 160 - 80 = 80
He uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money for dinner
3/5 x 80 = 48
80 - 48 = 32
The answer is 32. 
 Ali has 4 x $10 = $40 and 6 x $20 = $120.  In total, he has $40 + $120 = $160.  If he gives his sister half of the money, he gives $80.  He has $160 - $80 = $80 left. 

Then, he uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner.  To calculate 3/5 of $80, we need to convert the fraction to a decimal: 3/5 is the same as 0. 6.  $80 x 0. 6 = $48.  So he uses $48 to buy dinner.  He has $80 - $48 = $32 left.  The answer is 32. 
4 ten-dollar bills is 4 x 10 = 40 dollars.  6 twenty-dollar bills is 6 x 20 = 120 dollars.  Together, that's 40 + 120 = 160.  Ali gives his sister half of that amount, which is 160 / 2 = 80.  Now he has 160 - 80 = 80 dollars left.  Using 3/5 of the remaining 80 to buy dinner means he will spend 3/5 * 80 = 48 dollars.  He still has 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left.  The answer is 32. 
 Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills.  So he has a total of 4 x 10 = 40 dollars from the $10 bills and 6 x 20 = 120 dollars from the $20 bills.  In total, he has 40 + 120 = 160 dollars.  

Ali then gives his sister half of the money.  Half of 160 is 160 / 2 = 80.  He gives his sister 80 dollars.  So he has 160 - 80 = 80 dollars left. 

He then uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner.  To find 3/5 of 80, you can multiply 80 by 0. 6 (because 3/5 is the same as 0. 6).  80 * 0. 6 = 48.  

So, Ali uses 48 dollars for dinner.  He now has 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left.  The answer is 32. 
 First, let's find out how much money Ali has.  He has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 x 10 = 40 dollars and 6 $20 bills, which is 6 x 20 = 120 dollars.  40 + 120 = 160 dollars.  He gives away half of the 160 dollars, which is 160 / 2 = 80 dollars.  So he has 160 - 80 = 80 dollars remaining.  He then uses 3/5 of the remaining money for dinner.  3/5 of 80 is (3/5) x 80 = 48 dollars.  He spent 48 dollars for dinner.  So he has 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left.  The answer is 32. 
 Ali has 4 10 dollar bills and 6 20 dollar bills.  4 10 dollar bills is 4 * 10 = 40 dollars, and 6 20 dollar bills is 6 * 20 = 120 dollars.  So, in total, he has 40 + 120 = 160 dollars.  Ali gives his sister half of the total money, so 160 / 2 = 80 dollars.  Now he has 80 dollars left.  He uses 3/5 of this amount to buy dinner, which is 80 * (3/5) = 48 dollars.  So, he spends 48 dollars.  After spending money, he has 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left.  The answer is 32 dollars. 
10$ bill = 10, 20$ bill = 20, So 10 * 4 = 40$ 

40$ + 6 * 20 $ = 40 + 120$ = 160$.  

50 % of 160$ = 160 / 2 = 80$, so he gives half of the full amount to his sister, he left himself 80$.  

From the 80$, he used $\frac{3}{5}$ for dinner.  $\frac{3}{5}$ of 80$ = $\frac{3}{5}$ * 80$ = 48$, so he spent 48$ for dinner. 

The amount of money left is 80$ - 48$ = 32$.  

The answer is 32$.

Jame will be 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22. 

In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.  Let's call Jame's age in 8 years "x".  Since Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30, we can set up the equation: x = 2(30) - 5. 

Simplifying the equation, we get x = 55 - 5 = 50. 

Since his cousin's age in 8 years is 50, his current age is 50 - 8 = 42. 

To find the number of years that separate the age of the two, we subtract Jame's current age from his cousin's current age: 42 - 22 = 20. 

The answer is 20. 
 Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.  That means his current age is 27 - 5 = 22. 

Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be twice Jame's age in 8 years minus 5.  Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30.  Twice his age in 8 years will be 30 * 2 = 60.  Ten years younger than that is 60 - 10 = 50. 

Jame's cousin's current age is 50 - 8 = 42.  To find the difference in their ages now, subtract their ages: 22 - 42 = -20. 

The answer is 20.

[EXP] 82: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Sharon started with 5 dollars.  Then she got 1 dollar for each of 3 teeth, so that's 1 * 3 = 3 dollars.  Then she got half the amount for each of 2 teeth, so that's 1/2 * 2 = 1 dollar.  5 + 3 + 1 = 9.  The answer is 9. 
 Sharon started with 5 dollars.  For the next 3 teeth, she got another 1 dollar each.  5 + 3 = 8.  Then for the next 2 teeth, she got half of the 1 dollar, which is 0. 5 dollar each.  8 + 0. 5 * 2 = 8 + 1 = 9.  The answer is 9. 
 Sharon started with 5 dollars from the first tooth.  Then the tooth fairy gave her 1 dollar for each of the next 3 teeth, which is 1 x 3 = 3 dollars.  This makes a total of 5 + 3 = 8 dollars.  For the last 2 teeth, the tooth fairy gave her half of what she received for each of the previous 3 teeth, which is half of 1 dollar, or 0. 5 dollars.  So for the last 2 teeth, she received 0. 5 x 2 = 1 dollar.  This makes a total of 8 + 1 = 9 dollars.  The answer is 9. 
 Sharon initially got $5. 00 from the tooth fairy.  Then she got $1. 00 each for the next three teeth, so that's an additional $3. 00.  Then for the last two teeth, she got half of $1. 00 each, which is $0. 50 each.  For both teeth, that's $1. 00 more.  So in total, she got $5. 00 + $3. 00 + $1. 00 = $9. 00.  The answer is 9. 
 Sharon started with 5 dollars.  She got 1 dollar for each of the next 3 teeth, so that's 3 more dollars.  For the next 2 teeth, she got half the amount as before, which is half of 1 dollar, or 0. 50 per tooth.  So that's another 1 dollar.  In total, Sharon got 5 + 3 + 1 = 9 dollars.  The answer is 9. 
 Sharon started with 5 dollars.  Then, the tooth fairy gave her 1 dollar for each of 3 teeth, so 3 * 1 = 3 dollars.  Total, Sharon has now 5 + 3 = 8 dollars.  Then, the tooth fairy gave her half the amount per tooth for each of the next 2 teeth, so half of 1 dollar is 0. 5 dollars.  So for 2 teeth, she got 0. 5 * 2 = 1 dollar.  8 + 1 = 9.  The answer is 9. 
 The tooth fairy left Sharon 5 dollars.  Then, the tooth fairy gave Sharon 1 dollar each for 3 teeth, so 3 more dollars.  That makes a total of 5 + 3 = 8.  Now, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half a dollar each for the last 2 teeth.  Half a dollar for 2 teeth is 1 dollar.  So in total, the tooth fairy gave Sharon 8 + 1 = 9 dollars.  The answer is 9. 
 Sharon received $5. 00 for the first tooth.   Then, she received $1. 00 for each of the next three teeth, for a total of 3 x $1. 00 = $3. 00.   For the last 2 teeth, she received half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth, which means she received \$0. 50 for each of those two teeth, for a total of 2 x $0. 50 = $1. 00.   Adding the total amount of money she received for all the teeth, we have $5. 00 + $3. 00 + $1. 00 = $9. 00.   The answer is 9. 
 Sharon started with 5 dollars.  Then for each of the next 3 teeth, she received 1 dollar each, so that's 1 x 3 = 3 more dollars.  For each of the next 2 teeth, she received half the amount of money per tooth as she received for the previous 3 teeth.  So she received half of 1 dollar each, which is 0. 5 dollars each.  2 x 0. 5 = 1 dollar.  So she received 1 more dollar for those last 2 teeth.  In total, she received 5 + 3 + 1 = 9 dollars.  The answer is 9. 
 The tooth fairy left Sharon $5 initially.  For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1 each, so that is an additional $3.  So, Sharon now has $5 + $3 = $8.  For the next 2 teeth, the tooth fairy gave half of the amount she had given for the previous three teeth, which was $1.  So, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0. 5 each, an additional $1.  So, Sharon now has $8 + $1 = $9.  The answer is 9. 
 Sharon originally got 5 dollars.  For the next three teeth, she got 1 dollar each.  1 x 3 = 3.  So she had 5 + 3 = 8 dollars.  For the last two teeth, she gets half the amount per tooth as the previous three, which was 1/2 dollar per tooth.  So for the two last teeth, she got 1/2 x 2 = 1 dollar.  So she has 8 + 1 = 9.  The answer is 9. 
 Sharon started with 5 dollars.  For the next three teeth she received 1 dollar each, so that is 1 * 3 = 3 more dollars.  So far, she has 5 + 3 = 8 dollars.  For the last two teeth, she received half of the amount the previous three, which is half of 1 dollar, or 0. 50.  So she received 0. 50 * 2 = 1 dollar for the last 2 teeth.  8 + 1 is 9.  The answer is 9. 
 Sharon started with 5 dollars.  For the next three teeth, she received 3 x 1 = 3 dollars.  
So now, she has 5 + 3 = 8 dollars.  
For each of the last two teeth, she received half of the amount as the previous three, which is half of 1 dollar, or 50 cents.  So she received 2 x 0. 5 = 1 dollar for those two teeth.  
Adding that to her total, she now has 8 + 1 = 9 dollars.  
The answer is 9. 
 Sharon started with 5 dollars.  Then, for each of 3 teeth, she received $1.  So she got 3 times 1 dollar, which is 3 dollars.  Then, for each of 2 more teeth, the tooth fairy gave her half of $1, which is $0. 50.  So, she got 2 times $0. 50, which is $1. 00.  The total amount of money Sharon received is 5 + 3 + 1 = 9.  The answer is 9. 
 Sharon got 5. 00 dollars for the first tooth.  Then she got 1. 00 for each of the next three teeth, so 1 * 3 = 3. 00 dollars.  The tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money for each of the last 2 teeth, so it was half of 1. 00, which is 0. 50, for each of the last 2 teeth.  So for the last 2 teeth, it was 0. 50 * 2 = 1. 00 dollars.  In total, the tooth fairy left Sharon 5. 00 + 3. 00 + 1. 00 = 9. 00 dollars.  The answer is 9. 00. 
 Sharon started with 5 dollars.  Then the tooth fairy gave her 1 dollar for each of 3 teeth, so that's 3 x 1 = 3 more dollars.  In total, the tooth fairy gave Sharon 5 + 3 = 8 dollars.  Then, for each of the last 2 teeth, the tooth fairy gave her half of what she got for the first 3 teeth.  So she got half of 1 dollar for each of those teeth, which is 0. 5 dollars for each.  2 x 0. 5 = 1 dollar.  Adding this to the total, Sharon got 8 + 1 = 9 dollars.  The answer is 9. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Sharon initially received $5. 00. 

Then, she received $1. 00 for each of the next three teeth, so that's an additional $3. 00. 

For the last two teeth, she received half of the amount, which is $0. 50 each.  So, that's an additional $1. 00 more. 

In total, the tooth fairy left Sharon:
- $5. 00 initially
+ $3. 00 for the next 3 teeth
+ $1. 00 for the last 2 teeth

Subtract the initial amount:
$5. 00 + $3. 00 = $8. 00
$8. 00 + $1. 00 = $9. 00

The answer is 9. 
 The tooth fairy started with $5.  Then, for each of the next 3 teeth, she gave Sharon $1. 00.  That is $1 * 3 = $3. 00 more money.  Then, for each of the last two teeth, she gave Sharon half the amount of money she gave for the previous 3 teeth, so half of $1. 00 per tooth, or $0. 50 per tooth.  For 2 teeth, that is $0. 50 * 2 = $1.  So, she gave Sharon$1. 00 more.  In total, she gave Sharon $5. 00 +$3. 00 + $1. 00 =$9. 00. 

The answer is 9. 
 Sharon starts with 5 dollars.  The tooth fairy gives her 1 dollar for 3 of the teeth.  So she gets 3 x 1 = 3 more dollars.  So now she has 5 + 3 = 8.  For the last 2 teeth, Sharon gets half the amount of money as each of the first 3, which is 0. 5 x 1 = 0. 5 dollars.  So for the last 2 teeth, she gets 0. 5 dollars x 2 = 1 dollar.  Therefore, the total amount of money the tooth fairy gave Sharon is 5 + 3 + 1.  The answer is 9.

[EXP] 83: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 37, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

First, they spend $3. 00 per loaf to make bread, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  So the cost of bread per sandwich is $3. 00 / 10 = $0. 30 per sandwich. 

Next, they spend $30. 00 on different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches.  So the cost per sandwich for cheese and condiments is $30. 00 / 10 = $3. 00 per sandwich. 

Total cost per sandwich is $0. 30 (for bread) + $3. 00 (for cheese and condiments) = $3. 30 per sandwich. 

They sell each sandwich for $7. 00.  To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost per sandwich from the selling price:

Net profit per sandwich = Selling price - Total cost per sandwich
= $7. 00 - $3. 30
= $3. 70

Since they sell 10 sandwiches, their total net profit is 10 x $3. 70 = $37.  The answer is 37. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Cost of bread: $3. 00 per loaf, each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  For 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf, so the cost of bread is 3 dollars. 

Cost of cheese and condiments: $30. 00 per 10 sandwiches.  This is in addition to the cost of bread, so the total cost is 3 dollars for bread and 30 dollars for cheese and condiments, totaling 33 dollars. 

Revenue: 10 sandwiches sold at 7 dollars each is 10 x 7 = 70 dollars. 

To find the net profit, subtract the total cost from the revenue: 70 - 33 = 37. 

The answer is 37. 
 First, let's find out how much the food truck spends per sandwich.  They spend $3. 00 on bread per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  So, the cost of bread is $3. 00 / 10 sandwiches = $0. 30 per sandwich.  They also spend $30. 00 on different cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches.  So, the cost of cheese and condiments is $30. 00 / 10 sandwiches = $3. 00 per sandwich.  The total cost per sandwich is then $0. 30 (bread) + $3. 00 (cheese and condiments) = $3. 30 per sandwich. 

The food truck sells each sandwich for $7. 00.  If they sell 10 sandwiches, the total revenue is 10 x $7. 00 = $70. 00. 

The total cost is 10 sandwiches x $3. 30 per sandwich = $33. 00. 

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $70. 00 - $33. 00 = $37. 00. 

The answer is 37. 
 Let's first find the total cost of making 10 sandwiches.  The bread costs $3 per loaf and makes 10 sandwiches, so the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3 x (since 1 loaf makes 10 sandwiches).  The cost of different cheeses and condiments is $30 per 10 sandwiches.  The total cost is $3 + $30 = $33 per 10 sandwiches. 

The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7 each, so the total revenue is 10 x $7 = $70. 

The net profit is the revenue minus the cost.  Net profit = Revenue - Cost = $70 - $33 = $37. 

The answer is 37. 
 First, let's find out how much the profit from selling the sandwiches is.  They sell 10 sandwiches for $7 each, so they make 10 x 7 = 70 dollars.  

The cost to make 10 sandwiches is $3 for the bread and $30 for the cheese and condiments.  This is a total of $33. 

The profit is the amount of money they make minus their costs.  So, their profit is 70 - 33 = 37. 

The answer is 37. 
 Let's start by finding out the cost per sandwich.  They source their bread for $3. 00 a loaf and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  So the bread cost per sandwich is 3 / 10 = 0. 30. 

They spend $30. 00 on different cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches.  Since there are 10 sandwiches, the cost per sandwich for cheese and condiments is 30 / 10 = 3. 00. 

So the total cost per sandwich is 0. 30 + 3. 00 = 3. 30. 

They sell each sandwich for $7. 00, so their revenue is 7. 00 x 10 = 70. 00. 

The total cost is the cost of bread and cheese and condiments: 0. 30 x 10 + 30. 00 = 30. 00 + 3. 00 = 33. 00. 

The net profit is the revenue minus the cost: 70. 00 - 33. 00 = 37. 00.

1 hour and 30 minutes = 90 minutes, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 125 minutes. 

To find the total time, add the two times: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes. 

The answer is 215. 
 First, we need to convert the time into minutes.  The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1 x 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.  The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes, which is 2 x 60 + 5 = 125 minutes.  So, in total, Max will watch 90 + 125 = 215 minutes of movies.  The answer is 215. 
1 hour and 30 minutes is 90 minutes.  2 hours and 5 minutes is 125 minutes.  Since Max will watch 2 movies, then 90 + 125 = 215.  The answer is 215. 
1 hour and 30 minutes is 90 minutes.  2 hours and 5 minutes is 125 minutes.  To add these two, 90 + 125 is 215.  So the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes.  The answer is 215. 
 To convert the duration of each movie to minutes, we can calculate:

First movie: 1 hour 30 minutes = 1 x 60 + 30 = 90 minutes
Second movie: 2 hours 5 minutes = 2 x 60 + 5 = 125 minutes

Total duration of both movies: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

The answer is 215 minutes. 
2 movies.  First movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes.  1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1 hour and 30 minutes is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.  Second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes.  2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes.  Add 5 more minutes to get 120 + 5 = 125.  Total time is 90 + 125 = 215.  The answer is 215. 
2 movies! First, let's convert the movie times to just minutes.  The first movie is 1 hour 30 minutes, which is 1 * 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.  The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes, which is 2 * 60 + 5 = 125 minutes.  In total, Max will watch 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.  The answer is 215. 
 Let's calculate the total time for each movie separately:

First movie: 1 hour and 30 minutes = 1 x 60 + 30 = 90 minutes

Second movie: 2 hours and 5 minutes = 2 x 60 + 5 = 125 minutes

To add the total time, we add the minutes: 90 + 125 = 215

The answer is 215. 
2 movies.  

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.  1 hour is 60 minutes, and 30 minutes is 30 minutes.  So the first movie is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes long. 

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.  2 hours is 120 minutes, and 5 minutes is 5 minutes.  So the second movie is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes. 

To find the total time, add the minutes together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes. 

The answer is 215. 
 First, find the total minutes of the first movie: 1 hour and 30 minutes is 1 * 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.   Then, find the total minutes of the second movie: 2 hours and 5 minutes is 2 * 60 + 5 = 125 minutes.   Add the two to find the total minutes Max will watch movies: 90 + 125 = 215.   The answer is 215. 
 Let's find the length of the first movie in minutes: 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 + 30 = 90 minutes. 

Let's find the length of the second movie in minutes: 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 + 5 = 125 minutes. 

The total number of minutes is the sum of the minutes for the two movies: 90 + 125 = 215.  The answer is 215. 
2 movies will take time.  The first one is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.  1 hour is 60 minutes and 30 minutes is 30 minutes.  So together they are 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.  The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.  2 hours is 120 minutes and 5 minutes is 5 minutes.  So together they are 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.  The total time to watch both movies is 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.  The answer is 215. 
 Max plans to watch 2 movies.  The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.  The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.  

To convert the movie times to minutes, we convert the hours to minutes.  1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1 hour and 30 minutes is 1 x 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.  2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes, and adding 5 minutes to that makes 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

[EXP] 85: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 52, [output]:  Jared originally typed at 47 words per minute.  After the lessons, he typed at 52 words per minute.  If he increases by 5 more words per minute, he will type at 52 + 5 = 57 words per minute.  The average of the three measurements is (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = (156) / 3 = 52.  The answer is 52. 
47 + 52 = 99 words per minute.  If he increases his typing speed by 5 words, it will be 52 + 5 = 57 words per minute.  So, the average is (47 + 52 + 57) / 3.  This is (156) / 3 = 52.  The answer is 52. 
 First, we need to find the total number of words per minute Jared typed in the three measurements.  He typed 47, 52, and 52 + 5 = 57 words.  47 + 52 + 57 = 156.  Then, to find the average, we divide the total by the number of measurements: 156 / 3 = 52.  The answer is 52. 
47 is the original speed.  After increasing it by 5, it becomes 47 + 5 = 52.  After increasing it by 5 again, it will become 52 + 5 = 57.  The average will be the sum of all three divided by 3, which is (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = (156) / 3 = 52.  The answer is 52. 
 Jared's original typing speed is 47 words per minute.  Then, after increasing his speed, he has 52 WPM.  Now, if he increases his typing speed by 5 more words, he will have 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.  The average of the three measurements is (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 52.  The answer is 52. 
 Jared started with 47 WPM.  Then his speed increased to 52 WPM.  So, the increase is 52 - 47 = 5 WPM.  After increasing his speed again by 5 WPM, he will have 52 + 5 = 57 WPM. 

To find the average of the three measurements, first add them up: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156. 

Next, divide the sum by the number of measurements: 156 / 3 = 52.  The answer is 52. 
 Jared's speed increased from 47 WPM to 52 WPM.  To get the total increase, subtract 47 from 52, which is 52 - 47 = 5.  Since he will increase his speed by 5 words again, the new speed will be 52 + 5 = 57.  To get the average of the three measurements, add 47, 52, and 57 and divide by 3.  47 + 52 + 57 = 156 and 156 / 3 = 52.  The answer is 52. 
 Jared started with 47 WPM.  Then his speed increased to 52 WPM.  So the difference is 52 - 47 = 5.  This means that his speed goes up by 5 each time.  If he increases his speed by 5 again, his new speed will be 52 + 5 = 57.  To find the average of the three measurements, we need to add them together and divide by 3.  47 + 52 + 57 = 156 and 156 divided by 3 is 52.  The answer is 52. 
47 is Jared's original speed.  52 is his speed after some lessons.  Then he increased it by 5, so his last speed was 52 + 5 = 57. 

To get the average, we need to add the 3 speeds and then divide by 3:
(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52. 

The answer is 52. 
 Jared starts with 47 WPM.  Then his speed increases to 52 WPM.  After increasing by 5 more, he will have 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.  The average of the three measurements will be the mean of 47, 52, and 57. 

47 + 52 + 57 = 156
To find the average, divide the sum by 3. 
156 ÷ 3 = 52. 

The answer is 52. 
 Jared started with 47 WPM.  After some lessons, it increased to 52 WPM.  So his increase is 52 - 47 = 5.  Then, he increases it again by 5, so now it's 52 + 5 = 57.  To get the average, we add up all his measurements: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.  And then we divide by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.  The answer is 52. 
 Jared starts with 47 words per minute (WPM).  After increasing to 52 WPM, he increases by 52 - 47 = 5 WPM.  If he increases it once more by 5 WPM, he will have 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.  

The average is the sum of all three speeds divided by three.  The sum is 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 WPM.  Dividing by three, we get 156 / 3 = 52 WPM.  The answer is 52 WPM. 
47 WPM, then 52 WPM, then another 5 more.  So the highest WPM is 52 + 5 = 57.  Now we need to find the average.  The average formula is (start + mid + end)/3.  (47+52+57)/3 = 156/3 = 52.  The answer is 52. 
1.  Jared starts with 47 words per minute.  He goes to 52 words per minute.  To find the difference, we do 52 - 47 = 5. 

So he increased his speed by 5 WPM. 

Now, he wants to increase his speed once more by 5 words.  So he will have 52 + 5 = 57 WPM. 

To find the average, we add the three speeds and divide by 3:
(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = (156) / 3 = 52. 

The answer is 52. 
 There were 47 words per minute originally.  Then there were 52 WPM after his speed increased.  So his speed increased by 52 - 47 = 5 words per minute.  Then he increased his speed again by 5 WPM.  So his new speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 words per minute.  

Then we need to find the average of the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57.  

47 + 52 + 57 = 156

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3. 

156 / 3 = 52

The answer is 52. 
 Let's break it down:

 Jareed started with 47 words per minute (WPM). 

 Then, after a lesson, his WPM increased to 52.  To find the increase, we subtract: 52 - 47 = 5. 

 He'll increase his WPM by 5 more: 52 + 5 = 57. 

 To find the average of the three measurements, we add them and divide by 3:
(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = (156) / 3 = 52. 

The answer is 52. 
 First, let's find out how many words Jared typed after increasing his speed one more time.  He starts with 47 WPM.  After the second test, he reaches 52 WPM.  So he increases his speed by 52 - 47 = 5 WPM in the second test.  If he increases his speed by 5 WPM when he tests it again, he will have 52 + 5 = 57 WPM. 

The three measurements are 47, 52, and 57.  To find the average, we add them up and divide by 3. 

(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52

The answer is 52. 
лада times Jared measured his typing speed, so he measured his speed 3 times, from 47 WPM, then 52 WPM, then again as he increased his speed by 5 words, which is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.  Originally he measured his speed in WPM like this: 47, 52, and then 57.  To find the average of these 3, we can add 47 + 52 + 57, which is 156, and divide by 3.  156 ÷ 3 is 52.  The answer is 52.

[EXP] 86: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Let's start by saying that Jerry's current age is x.  Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: x = 2(x-5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives: -x = -10

Adding 10 to both sides gives: x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.  To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

The answer is 13. 
 Let's first find Jerry's current age.  If he is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means his age 5 years ago is half of his current age. 

Let's call his current age "x".  Then, his age 5 years ago is x - 5.  Since he is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives:

-x = -10

Adding 10 to both sides gives:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

The answer is 13. 
 We can start by letting x be Jerry's current age.  Then, 5 years ago, Jerry was x - 5 years old.  The problem states that Jerry is currently twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation gives:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.  To find his age in 3 years, we can add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13

The answer is 13. 
 Let's start by assuming Jerry's current age is x. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means his age 5 years ago was x/2.  5 years ago, Jerry's age was x - 5. 

We can set up an equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-x = -10

Adding 10 to both sides:

x = 10

So Jerry's current age is 10. 

In 3 years, Jerry will be:

10 + 3 = 13

The answer is 13. 
 Let's start by saying Jerry's current age is X.  Since he is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means his age 5 years ago is X/2.  

We can set up an equation based on the information: X = X/2 + 5

To solve for X, we subtract X/2 from both sides: X - X/2 = 5

Combine like terms: X/2 = 5

Multiply both sides by 2: X = 10

So Jerry's current age is 10. 

To find how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

The answer is 13. 
 Let's start by saying that Jerry's current age is x.   Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can say that x = 2(x-5).  We can solve for x by first subtracting x from both sides of the equation: x - x = 2(x-5) - x, which simplifies to 0 = x - 10.  Then we can add 10 to both sides to get x = 10.  This means that Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we can add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13.  The answer is 13. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Jerry's current age is currently unknown.  Let's call it x. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means his age 5 years ago was x/2. 

Jerry's current age is x, which is 5 years more than 5 years ago.  So, x = x/2 + 5. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x/2 = x/2 + 5. 

Combine like terms: x = 5 + 5

x = 10

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

The answer is 13. 
 Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so let's call his current age x.  5 years ago, he was x - 5 years old.  His current age is 2 times that, or 2 * (x - 5).  Since he is currently x years old, we can set up the equation 2(x - 5) = x. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x - 10 = x, or x = 10.  So Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find his age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13.  The answer is 13. 
 Let's first find Jerry's current age.  Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, his current age must be twice his age 5 years ago, plus 5 years. 

Let x be Jerry's age 5 years ago.  Then, his current age is x + 5. 

We are told that Jerry's current age is twice his age 5 years ago, so we can set up the equation:

x + 5 = 2x

Subtract x from both sides to get:

5 = x

So Jerry was 5 years ago.  Therefore, his current age is 5 + 5 = 10. 

Now, to find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 10 + 3 = 13. 

The answer is 13. 
 Let's start by thinking of Jerry's current age as x.  Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means Jerry was x - 5 years old 5 years ago.  Now, Jerry is current age x.  The equation we can write is:

x = 2(x - 5)

We can solve for x:

x = 2x - 10
x + 10 = 2x
10 = x

So, Jerry is 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to 10:

10 + 3 = 13

The answer is 13. 
 Let's start by figuring out Jerry's current age.  Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means his age 5 years ago was half his current age.  Let's call his current age x.  Then, x/2 is his age 5 years ago.  

Now let's set up an equation to solve for x: x = x/2 + 5

This equation means Jerry's current age is equal to the age he was 5 years ago (x/2) plus 5. 

Solving for x, we get: x = 10

So Jerry is 10 years old currently. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

The answer is 13. 
 We need to figure out how old Jerry is first.  If he is 2 times as old as he was 5 years ago, that means he was X years old 5 years ago.  Then now he is X + 5 years old.  We can use the equation 2(X + 5) = X, to solve for X (Jerry's age now).  Solving the equation, we get X = 10.  So Jerry is 10 years old now.  In 3 years, he will be 13.  The answer is 13.

1200 miles were traveled in 3 hours.  So the rate of travel is:

1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour

To travel an additional 2000 miles, the time needed is:

2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours

The answer is 5 hours. 
1200 miles in 3 hours is the same rate as 400 miles per hour.  If there are 2000 more miles, it will take 2000/400 = 5 hours.  The answer is 5. 
1200 miles took 3 hours.  To find the speed, divide the distance by the time: 1200 / 3 = 400 miles per hour.  Then, to find the time for an additional 2000 miles, divide the distance by the speed: 2000 / 400 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
1200 miles is traveled in 3 hours.  We can find the distance traveled per hour by dividing 1200 by 3.  1200 ÷ 3 = 400.  So the plane travels 400 miles in 1 hour.  To find out how many hours it would take to travel 2000 miles, we can divide 2000 by 400.  2000 ÷ 400 = 5.  The answer is 5.

1200 miles in 3 hours means the rate is 1200 / 3 miles per hour.  That is 400 miles per hour.  To find how many hours it would take to travel 2000 miles at this rate, we do 2000 / 400.  That is 5 hours.  The answer is 5. 
1200 miles are traveled in 3 hours.  So the plane travels 1200/3 = 400 miles per hour.  After traveling 1200 miles, we want to know how many hours it takes to travel 2000 more miles.  That is 400 * 5 = 2000 miles.  The answer is 5. 
 First, we need to find the distance the plane travels in one hour.  To do this, we can divide the distance it travels in 3 hours by 3:

1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour

Now, we know the plane travels 400 miles per hour.  To find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles, we can divide the additional distance by the distance per hour:

2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours

So, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.  The answer is 5. 
 The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours.  We need to find the distance it travels per hour.  1200 / 3 = 400.  So it travels 400 miles in 1 hour.  

We know it travels 2000 miles more.  To travel this distance, it would take 2000 / 400 = 5 more hours.  The answer is 5. 
 Let's first find the distance per hour.  1200 miles is traveled in 3 hours, so we divide 1200 by 3 to get the distance per hour.  1200 / 3 = 400 miles per hour.  Now we can find the time to travel 2000 miles at this rate.  2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.  The answer is 5. 
1200 miles are covered in 3 hours.  So in 1 hour, 1200 miles / 3 hours is 400 miles.  Now we must find out how many hours are needed to travel an additional 2000 miles.  2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.  The answer is 5. 
1200 miles took 3 hours.  How many miles per hour did the plane travel? To find the rate, we need to divide the distance by the time.  1200 / 3 = 400 miles per hour.  If the plane is traveling at the same rate, we know it travels 400 miles in 1 hour.  To find out how many hours it takes to travel 2000 miles, we can divide the distance by the rate.  2000 / 400 = 5.  The plane would take 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.  The answer is 5. 
1200 miles were travelled in 3 hours.  If the same rate is maintained, to find the distance travelled per hour, we can divide 1200 by 3, which is 400. 

So, to travel 2000 miles at the same rate, we have to divide 2000 by 400.  2000 / 400 is 5. 

So, the plane takes 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate. 

The answer is 5. 
1200 miles in 3 hours is 400 miles per hour.  We are asked to find out how many additional hours it will take to travel an additional 2000 miles.  400 miles per hour times X hours will be 2000 miles.  So 400X = 2000.  Divide by 400 on both sides and that means X = 5.  The plane will take an additional 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.  The answer is 5.

So, the number of women who can stay upright is 0. 6 x 25 = 15.  This means the number of men who can stay upright is 25 - 15 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
25% of 100 riders can stay upright.  100 * 0. 25 = 25 riders.  Of those, 60% are women.  25 * 0. 6 = 15 women.  So the remaining are men.  25 - 15 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
100 riders arrive.  Only 25% of them, or 100 x 0. 25 = 25, can stay upright.  Of these 25, 60%, or 25 x 0. 6 = 15, are women.  That means 25 - 15 = 10 men can stay upright.  The answer is 10. 
100 surfers are riding the wave.  25% of them can stay upright, so 25/100 * 100 = 25 surfers can stay upright.  Of these, 60% are women, so 60/100 * 25 = 15 women can stay upright.  Men are the rest, so 25 - 15 = 10 men can stay upright on the wave.  The answer is 10. 
100 riders in total and 25% of them can stay upright, so there are 25% x 100 = 25 riders who can stay upright.  Out of these 25 riders, 60% are women, so 25 x 60% = 15 are women.  The rest are men, which is 25 - 15 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
100 are the total riders.  25% of 100 is 0. 25 x 100 = 25.  So 25 of the riders can stay upright.  From these, 60% are women.  0. 6 x 25 = 15.  So 15 are women.  That means 25 - 15 = 10 are men.  The answer is 10. 
100 surfers are allowed on the wave.  Of these, only 25% can stay upright.  To find 25% of 100, multiply 100 by 0. 25, which is 25.  So 25 surfers can stay upright.  Of these 25, 60% are women.  To find 60% of 25, multiply 25 by 0. 6, which is 15.  So 15 are women and 25 - 15 = 10 are men.  The answer is 10. 
1st, there are 100 riders.  25% of 100 is 25.  So 25 riders can stay upright.  Then, 60% of those riders are women, and the rest are men.  So 60% of 25 = 15 are women, and 25 - 15 = 10 are men.  The answer is 10. 
100 riders were initially seen.  Of them, 25% (0. 25) can stay upright.  So 0. 25 * 100 = 25 riders can stay upright.  Among these 25, 60% are women.  So the number of women is 0. 6 * 25 = 15.  The remaining 25 - 15 = 10 are men.  The answer is 10. 
100 total riders ride the wave.  Of these, 25% can stay upright.  25% of 100 is 25. 

So 25 riders can stay upright.  Of the 25 riders who can stay upright, 60% are women.  60% of 25 is 15. 

To find the number of men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright: 25 - 15 = 10. 

The answer is 10. 
100 riders are trying to ride the wave.  Only 25% of them, which is 0. 25 * 100 = 25 riders, can stay upright.  Of these riders, 60% are women.  So 60% of 25 = 0. 6 * 25 = 15 are women.  There are 25 riders who can stay upright, and 15 of them are women.  So, 25 - 15 = 10 men can stay upright on the wave.  The answer is 10. 
1) First we need to find the total number of riders that can stay upright.  Since 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we find 25% of 100 which is 0. 25 x 100 = 25 riders. 

2) Of these 25 riders, 60% are women.  So the number of women is 0. 6 x 25 = 15. 

3) To find the number of men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders that can stay upright.  25 - 15 = 10. 

The answer is 10. 
1st, figure out how many can stay upright.  100 * 0. 25 = 25.  So 25 riders can stay upright.  Next, figure out how many of these riders are women.  25 * 0. 6 = 15.  15 are women.  So the men are 25 - 15.  25 - 15 is 10.  The answer is 10. 
25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, so 25% x 100 = 25 riders can stay upright.  Of these, 60% are women.  To find the number of men that can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders:

25 (total riders) - (0. 6 x 25 = 15) (women) = 25 - 15 = 10

The answer is 10. 
25% of the riders can stay upright, and 60% of these are women.  This means that 60% × 25% = 15% of all riders are women who can stay upright.  Since there are 100 riders, the number of women who can stay upright is 15% × 100 = 15.  Since 60% of these are women, 100% - 60% = 40% are men.  The number of men who can stay upright is 40% × 25% × 100 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
100 riders total, so 25% of 100 = 25 riders can stay upright.  Of these 25, 60% are women.  So, the number of women is 25 * 0. 6 = 15.  To find the remaining men, subtract from the total number of riders who can stay upright, 25 - 15 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
100 riders total.  Then 25% (or 0. 25) can stay upright, which would be 100 x 0. 25 = 25.  Of these riders, 60% (or 0. 6) are women.  So the number of women that can stay upright is 25 x 0. 6 = 15.  So the number of men that can stay upright is 25 - 15 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
1.  First, find the number of riders who can stay upright.  25% of 100 riders is 0. 25 x 100 = 25.  This is the number that can stay upright. 

2.  60% of these 25 riders are women.  0. 6 x 25 = 15.  So, 15 women can stay upright. 

3.  To find the number of men, subtract the number of women who can stay upright from the total number of riders who can stay upright.  25 - 15 = 10. 

The answer is 10. 
25% of the 100 riders can stay upright.  25% of 100 is 25.  So, 25 / 100 x 100 = 25 riders can stay upright. 

Of these 25 riders, 60% are women.  So, the number of men that can stay upright is 25 - 60% = 100% - 60% = 40% of 25. 

40% of 25 is 40/100 x 25 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
100 riders arrived to ride the wave.  Of those, 25% can stay upright.  To find 25% of 100, we can do 100 / 4 = 25.  So 25 riders can stay upright.  60% of these 25 passengers are women, so 60% of 25 is 25 * 0. 6 = 15 women.  To find the number of men, we subtract 15 from 25: 25 - 15 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
100 riders in total, of which 25% can stay upright.  25% is the same as 0. 25.  0. 25 x 100 = 25 riders can stay upright.  Out of these 25, 60% are women.  60% is the same as 0. 6.  0. 6 x 25 = 15 women.  Since there are 100 riders in total, the number of men is 100 - 15 = 85.  Out of these 85 men, Tiffany is interested in how many can stay upright.  Since 25 riders in total can stay upright, and 15 of those are women, the remaining men who can stay upright are 25 - 15 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
100 is the total number of riders.  25% of 100 is 25.  This means 100 x 0. 25 = 25 can stay upright.  The question asks about men, not about the total riders staying upright.  It says 60% of those 25 are women, so the number of women staying upright is 25 x 0. 6 = 15.  The number of men staying upright will then be 25 - 15 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
25% of the riders can stay upright.  That means 1 out of 4 riders (or 25%) can stay upright.  So, if there are 100 riders, 25% of them is 25%.  25% of 100 is 25, so there are 25 riders who can stay upright.  Of those 25 riders, 60% are women.  60% of 25 is 15.  That means there are 15 women who can stay upright.  Since we want to find the number of men who can stay upright, we will subtract the number of women from the original 25.  25 - 15 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
1) First, we need to calculate the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave.  25% of 100 riders can ride the wave, which is 25% * 100 = 25 riders. 

2) Among these riders, 60% are women.  60% of 25 riders is 60% * 25 = 15 women. 

3) Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 25 riders - 15 women = 10 men.  The answer is 10.

 Let's solve this step by step!

We know that Steve is 60 years old, and his wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old. 

Their son is currently half as old as his mom, so he is half of 64 = 32 years old. 

Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old. 

The answer is 29. 
 Let's start by finding the age of Steve's son.  Since his mom is 4 years older than Steve, which is 60 years old, she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.  Since the son is half as old as his mom, he is 64/2 = 32 years old. 

Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, the son.  So, she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.  The answer is 29. 
1.  Steve is 60 years old.  His wife is 4 years older, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.  Their son is half as old as his mom, so their son is 64/2 = 32 years old. 

Now we have: Steve is 60, his wife is 64, their son is 32, and his wife is 3 years younger than her husband.  The son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old. 

The answer is 29. 
 First, we need to find the age of Steve's son and his wife's age.  Steve is 60 years old.  His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife's age is 64. 

Their son is half the age of his mom, so their son's age is half of 64, which is 32. 

Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband.  So her age is 32 - 3 = 29.  The answer is 29. 
1) First, we will calculate the age of Steve's wife.  She is 4 years older than Steve, so 60 + 4 = 64. 
  2) Next, we will calculate the age of Steve's son.  He is half as old as his mom, so his mom's age divided by 2.  64 / 2 is 32. 
  3) Finally, we will calculate the age of Steve's son's wife.  She is 3 years younger than her husband, who is 32.  So 32 - 3 = 29.  The answer is 29. 
1.  First, we can solve for Steve's wife's age.  Steve is 60, and his wife is 4 years older, so she is 60 + 4 = 64. 

2.  Next, we can solve for their son's age.  The son is half as old as his mom, and his mom is 64.  Half of 64 is 64 / 2 = 32, so the son is 32. 

3.  Finally, we can solve for the son's wife's age.  The son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, and the son is 32.  So the son's wife's age is 32 - 3 = 29. 

The answer is 29. 
1.  Let's find out the age of Steve's wife:
Steve is 60 years old, and his wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife's age is 60 + 4 = 64 years old. 

2.  Steve's son's age is half his mom's age.  His mother's age is 64, so his son's age is 64 / 2 = 32 years old. 

3.  Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than his husband.  His husband's age is 32, so Steve's son's wife's age is 32 - 3 = 29 years old. 

The answer is 29. 
1st step: Calculate Steve's family members' ages:
    CM - Steve - 60
    CM - Steve's wife - 60 + 4 = 64
    CM - Steve's son - 64 / 2 = 32
    CM - son's wife - 32 - 3 = 29

[EXP] 94: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2100, [output]:  Ariadne had $400 from selling red hats.  This is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats.  So, the total she earned from selling green hats is 2 x 400 = 800 dollars.  The total amount she earned in the first month is 800 + 400 = 1200 dollars.  In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales in the first month, so she made 1200 x 3/4 = 900 dollars.  In two months, she made 1200 + 900 = 2100 dollars.  The answer is 2100. 
 Ariadne earned 400 dollars from red hats in the first month.  Since her sales from red hats were half the total from green hats, she earned 2 x 400 = 800 dollars from green hats in the first month.  So in the first month, Ariadne made 400 + 800 = 1200 dollars.  In the second month, her sales were 3/4 the total of the first month.  So in the second month, she earned 3/4 x 1200 = 900 dollars.  In total, she earned 1200 + 900 = 2100 dollars in two months.  The answer is 2100. 
 First, we find the total amount of money earned from selling green hats: 2 * 400 = 800. 

Second, we calculate the total amount earned in the first month: 800 + 400 = 1200. 

Next, we find the total amount earned in the second month: 1200 * 3/4 = 900. 

Finally, we find the total amount earned in two months: 1200 + 900 = 2100.  The answer is 2100. 
 If her sales from red hats were 400 in one month, then her sales from green hats were 2 times that, which is 800.  The total sales for that month is 400 + 800 = 1200. 

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month, which is 3/4 * 1200 = 900.  So, in the second month she made $900 from red and green hats. 

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of both months: 900 + 1200 = 2100. 

The answer is 2100. 
1st month: 
Ariadne's sales from red hats are 400 dollars.  She makes half as much from green hats, so 400 * 2 = 800 dollars.  Total amount in 1 month is 400 + 800 = 1200 dollars. 

In the second month, Ariadne makes 3/4 of the sales she made in the first month.  
1st month's sales: 1200 dollars
3/4 * 1200 = 900 dollars. 

Her total sales for both months are 1200 + 900 = 2100 dollars.  The answer is 2100. 
 Ariadne made 400 dollars from red hats in a particular month.  That was half of her total earnings from selling green hats.  So, the total amount she made from selling green hats is 2 x 400 = 800 dollars.  The total amount she made in that month is 800 + 400 = 1200 dollars. 

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales in the first month.  So, 0. 75 x 1200 = 900.  It seems that this is the amount of sales of both red and green hats combined.  Since the sales of red hats were half of the total sales in the first month, their sales in the second month must also be 400 dollars.  Then the sales of green hats in the second month must have been 900 - 400 = 500.

2.  It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so the time to cook pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes. 
3.  Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.  To find the combined cooking time, we add the cooking times of pork and rice: 50 + 30 = 80.  Half of 80 is 40. 
4.  So, beans took 40 minutes to cook. 
5.  Now we can find the total time it took to cook all the food: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120. 

The answer is 120. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step!

It takes Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice. 

Since it takes her 20 more minutes to cook the pork than it takes to cook the rice, it takes her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook the pork. 

The beans take half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.  So, half of 30 + 50 = 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.  Therefore, it takes Finley 40 minutes to cook the beans. 

To find the total cooking time, add the cooking times of rice, pork, and beans: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes. 

The answer is 120. 
 Let's break this down step by step. 

1.  Rice took 30 minutes to cook. 
2.  Pork took 20 more minutes than rice, so pork took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes. 
3.  Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.  Combine pork and rice minutes: 50 + 30 = 80.  Beans took half of this: 80 / 2 = 40 minutes. 
4.  Now, add up the cooking times for all food: rice + pork + beans = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes. 

The answer is 120. 






Let's break this down step by step. 

1.  It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. 
2.  It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so to cook pork it took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes. 
3.  It took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice to cook beans.  Combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes.  Half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes. 
4.  Now we add up the cooking times: rice + pork + beans = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes. 

So it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food.  The answer is 120 minutes. 
30 minutes is the time it took to cook rice.  Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, it took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.  

We need to find the time it took to cook beans.  It took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.  50 + 30 is 80.  Half of 80 is 40.  So it took 40 minutes to cook beans.  

We now have: rice - 30 minutes, pork - 50 minutes, beans - 40 minutes.  To find the total time, we add them up: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120.  The answer is 120. 
 Let's break this down step by step! 

It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, so cooking pork will take 30 + 20 = 50 minutes. 

Beans take half the combined time of cooking pork and rice.  The combined time is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes.  Half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes. 

To cook all the food, Finley spent 30 minutes on rice, 50 minutes on pork, and 40 minutes on beans.  Adding these up, we get 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.  The answer is 120. 
1.  If it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, then it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork. 

2.  Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, and rice took 30 minutes, then beans took (50 + 30)/2 = 40 minutes to cook. 

3.  To sum the cooking times of all the food, we need to add the times it took to cook rice, pork, and beans: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120. 

The answer is 120. 
30 minutes is the time it took to cook the rice.  Let's find the time it took to cook the pork.  It was 20 minutes more, so 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.  To find the time it took to cook the beans, we combine the time it took to cook the rice and pork: 30 + 50 = 80.  The beans took half this time, so 80 ÷ 2 = 40.  Now we add the time it took to cook each food together: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120.  The answer is 120. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step.  We know that it took 30 minutes to cook rice.  We are told that it took Finley 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.  So, it took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.  We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.  Combined cooking time of pork and rice would be 30 + 50 = 80 minutes.  Half of that is 40 minutes.  So, it took 40 minutes to cook beans. 

Now, let's add the time it took to cook all the food: rice - 30 minutes, pork - 50 minutes, beans - 40 minutes.  Total time = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.  The answer is 120. 
1.  Step 1: It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.  Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork. 

2.  Step 2: Cooking beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.  Combined cooking time of pork and rice = 30 + 50 = 80.  Half of that is 80 / 2 = 40. 

3.  Step 3: Cook pork and rice took a total of 30 + 50 = 80 minutes.  Cooking beans took 40 minutes.  Cooking all the food took 80 + 40 = 120 minutes.  The answer is 120. 
 We will solve for the time it took to cook pork and beans. 

Since it took 30 minutes to cook rice, it took 20 more minutes to cook pork.  So, cooking pork took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes. 

Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.  The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes.  Half of this is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.  So cooking beans took 40 minutes. 

Add the time spent cooking each food: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.  The answer is 120.

[EXP] 97: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Christina records her mood every day on a calendar.  Over the past thirty days of moods, she had twelve good days and eight bad days and the rest were neutral.  Her first eight days were good, her second eight days were bad, and her third eight days were neutral. 

Let's count the good days:
She had the first 8 good days initially.  12 - 8 = 4 good days left.  Then the next 3 good days, so 4 + 3 = 7. 

The answer is 7.

 Christina started with 12 good days.  Then, the first 8 days were good, so 12 - 8 = 4 good days left.  She had 8 neutral days after the first 16 days, so the next 8 days were bad, but the good days don't change.  Then the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.  So there are 4 + 3 = 7 good days left in the month.  The answer is 7. 
30 days, 12 were good, 8 were bad, and the rest were neutral.  If the first 8 days were good, then that accounts for 8.  If the second 8 days were bad, that accounts for 8 more.  12 - 8 - 8 = 12 - 16 = 4.  But the third 8 days were neutral, so there are 8 more neutral days.  4 (good) + 8 (neutral) = 12, so 18 good and neutral days in total, leaving 30 - 18 = 12 bad days.

 Brittany started with 14 red squares.  There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so she has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.  There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so she has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.  And there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so she has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares. 

So the total number of squares is 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares. 

Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so each square is 1 square foot.  The total area is 68 square feet. 
The answer is 68. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step.  

Number of red squares = 14
Number of blue squares = Number of red squares + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18
Number of green squares = Number of blue squares + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
Number of white squares = Number of green squares - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12

Total number of squares = Number of red squares + Number of blue squares + Number of green squares + Number of white squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the area is equal to the number of squares, which is 68.  The answer is 68 square feet. 
 Brittany's quilted comforter has 14 red squares.  It has 4 more blue squares than red squares, so it has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.  It has 6 more green squares than blue squares, so it has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.  It has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so it has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.  There are 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 individual squares in total.  Since each square is 1ft by 1ft, the total area in square feet is 68 * 1 * 1 = 68.  The answer is 68. 
 Brittany's quilted comforter has 14 red squares.  There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.  So she has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.  There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.  So she has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.  There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.  So she has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares. 

The total number of colored squares is 14 red + 18 blue + 24 green + 12 white = 68. 

Since the squares are 1 foot by 1 foot, each square is 1 square foot.  So, the total area of the comforter in square feet is 68 square feet.  The answer is 68. 
 Let's start by identifying the number of each colored square:
	* Red squares: 14
	* Blue squares: 14 + 4 = 18
	* Green squares: 18 + 6 = 24
	* White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

Now, let's find the total square footage of the comforter by multiplying the number of each colored square by the area of a single square foot (1 ft x 1 ft = 1 sq ft):

	* Red squares: 14 x 1 sq ft = 14 sq ft
	* Blue squares: 18 x 1 sq ft = 18 sq ft
	* Green squares: 24 x 1 sq ft = 24 sq ft
	* White squares: 12 x 1 sq ft = 12 sq ft

Total square footage: 14 sq ft + 18 sq ft + 24 sq ft + 12 sq ft = 68 sq ft

The answer is 68. 
 Let's break this problem down:

* There are 14 red squares. 
* There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares. 
* There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. 
* There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares. 

To find the total number of square feet, we multiply the number of each color square by 1 foot by 1 foot (1 square feet):

* Red: 14 squares x 1 x 1 = 14 square feet
* Blue: 18 squares x 1 x 1 = 18 square feet
* Green: 24 squares x 1 x 1 = 24 square feet
* White: 12 squares x 1 x 1 = 12 square feet

Add up the number of square feet for each color to find the total:
14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 square feet

The answer is 68 square feet. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step:
- there are 14 red squares, which is equal to the number of blue squares minus 4.  So, there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares. 
- there are 18 blue squares, which is equal to the number of green squares minus 6.  So, there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. 
- there are 24 green squares, which is equal to the number of white squares plus 12.  So, there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares. 

The total number of squares is 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares. 

Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area is 68 x 1 x 1 = 68 square feet. 

The answer is 68. 
 Brittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares. 

1) Red squares: 14 red squares
2) Blue squares: 4 more blue squares than red squares.  So, blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares
3) Green squares: 6 more green squares than blue squares.  So, green squares = 18 + 6 = 24 green squares
4) White squares: 12 fewer white squares than green squares.  So, white squares = 24 - 12 = 12 white squares

Total number of squares = red + blue + green + white = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Total square feet of the comforter = Total number of squares * 1 ft * 1 ft = 68 * 1 * 1 = 68 square feet

The answer is 68. 
 Let's start by finding the number of blue squares.  Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.  

Next, let's find the number of green squares.  Since there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24. 

Finally, let's find the number of white squares.  Since there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12. 

Now, we know the number of each colored square: 

- Red squares: 14
- Blue squares: 18
- Green squares: 24
- White squares: 12

To find the total square feet, we multiply the number of each color by 1 foot by 1 foot:

- Red squares: 14 * 1 * 1 = 14 square feet
- Blue squares: 18 * 1 * 1 = 18 square feet
- Green squares: 24 * 1 * 1 = 24 square feet
- White squares: 12 * 1 * 1 = 12 square feet

Then, we add the square feet of each color to get the total square feet:

14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

The answer is 68. 
 Let's start by identifying the number of blue squares.  We are given that the comforter has 4 more blue squares than red squares.  Since there are 14 red squares, there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares. 

Next, we are given that there are 6 more green squares than blue squares.  Since there are 18 blue squares, there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. 

Now, we are given that there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.  Since there are 24 green squares, there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares. 

In total, the comforter has 14 red squares, 18 blue squares, 24 green squares, and 12 white squares.  Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area of the comforter is:

14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Each square has an area of 1 square foot, so the total area of the comforter is:

68 x 1 = 68 square feet

The answer is 68. 
 Brittany's quilted comforter is made up of 1 ft x 1 ft = 1 sq ft square.  There are 14 red squares.  There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.  So there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

[EXP] 103: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 30 pounds at 1. 5 dollars per pound will be 30 x 1. 5 = 45 dollars.  Total cost at the blueberry patch was 20 + 45 = 65 dollars.  Buying 30 pounds at 2. 5 dollars per pound will be 30 x 2. 5 = 75 dollars.  James saved 75 - 65 = 10 dollars.  The answer is 10. 
20 dollars was spent on going picking, and then 30 pounds were picked at 1. 5 dollars per pound.  So the total cost was 20 + (30 x 1. 5) = 20 + 45 = 65 dollars.  If he had bought it at the store, he would have spent 30 x 2. 5 = 75 dollars.  So he saved 75 - 65 = 10 dollars.  The answer is 10. 
 Let's break it down step by step.  James pays 20 dollars to go blueberry picking.  Then, he picked 30 pounds of blueberries, and it costs him 1. 5 dollars per pound.  So the total cost of picking the blueberries is 20 + (1. 5 * 30) = 20 + 45 = 65 dollars. 

If he would have bought the blueberries at the store for 2. 5 dollars per pound, it would have cost him 2. 5 * 30 = 75 dollars. 

So, he saved 75 - 65 = 10 dollars by picking his own blueberries. 

The answer is 10. 
 James spent $20 on picking and then $1. 5 per pound for 30 pounds, which is 30 x 1. 5 = 45 dollars.  So in total he spent 45 + 20 = 65 dollars.  The total cost if he bought it from store would have been 2. 5 * 30 = 75 dollars.  He saved 75 - 65 = 10 dollars.  The answer is 10. 
 James has to pay $20 to go picking and $1. 5 per pound of blueberries.  So, he has to pay 20 + (1. 5 * 30) = 20 + 45 = 65 dollars in total.  He could have bought the blueberries at the store for $2. 5 per pound, in total, it would cost him 2. 5 * 30 = 75 dollars.  So, he saved 75 - 65 = 10 dollars.  The answer is 10. 
 James originally spent 20 dollars to go picking, then 30 pounds at 1. 5 dollars per pound will cost 30 x 1. 5 = 45 dollars at the farm.  So in total he spent 20 + 45 dollars = 65 dollars.  If he bought at the store, 30 pounds would cost 30 x 2. 5 = 75 dollars.  So he saved 75 - 65 dollars = 10 dollars.  The answer is 10. 
 James started by spending $20 for going picking blueberries.  Then he picked 30 pounds, at $1. 5 per pound, so he spent 30 * 1. 5 = 45 dollars for the blueberries.  In total he spent 20 + 45 = 65 dollars. 

Instead, if James would have bought the blueberries at the store, he would have spent 30 * 2. 5 = 75 dollars.  Since he spent 65 dollars, he saved 75 - 65 = 10 dollars. 

The answer is 10. 
 James started with a cost of $20 to go picking.  To pick 30 pounds of blueberries, it would cost 1. 5 * 30 = 45 dollars.  This is a total cost of $20 + $45 = $65. 

If he had bought blueberries at the store for $2. 5 per pound, that would have cost 2. 5 * 30 = 75 dollars. 

To find out how much he saved, subtract the cost of picking blueberries from the cost of buying at the store: 75 - 65 = 10. 

The answer is 10. 
 James spent 20 for the trip.  It cost him another 1. 5 dollars per pound.  For 30 pounds, the cost would be 1. 5 * 30 = 45.  In total, he spent 20 + 45 = 65.  If he bought at the store for 2. 5 dollars per pound, it would cost 2. 5 * 30 = 75.  Since 65 is less than 75, he saved 75 - 65 = 10 dollars.  The answer is 10. 
 First, let's find the total cost of buying the blueberries at the cost of $1. 5 per pound.  30 pounds would be 30 x 1. 5 = 45 dollars.   Then, there is a 20 dollar cost to go picking, so James paid 45 + 20 = 65 dollars.  If James wanted to buy them at the store for 2. 5 dollars a pound, it would cost 30 x 2. 5 = 75 dollars.   James saved 75 - 65 dollars, which is 10 dollars.  The answer is 10. 
 James spent the $20 to go picking blueberries, and then picked 30 pounds at $1. 5 per pound.  The total cost of blueberries James picked is:

20 (initial cost) + (30 x 1. 5) (cost of blueberries) = 20 + 45 = 65

James could have bought the same amount of blueberries at the store for 30 x 2. 5 = 75 dollars.  To find out how much he saved, subtract the cost of picking blueberries from the cost of buying blueberries:

75 - 65 = 10

James saved 10 dollars compared to buying at the store.  The answer is 10. 
 For pick blueberries, James has to pay 20 dollars for going picking.  After that he will pick 30 pounds.  30 * 1. 5 = 45 dollars.  So the total cost is 20 + 45 = 65.  Now we know that if he bought at the store, 30 * 2. 5 is 75 dollars.  So to buy blueberries at the store would have cost James 75 - 65 dollars more.  75 - 65 is 10.  The answer is 10. 
 The problem states that James goes blueberry picking for $20 and pays $1. 5 per pound, then buys 30 pounds.  So, 30 x $1. 5 = $45 for the blueberries.  Therefore, James's total cost for the blueberries is 20 + 45 = 65 dollars. 
The problem also states that James would have bought them elsewhere for $2. 5 per pound.  For 30 pounds, that would be 30 x $2. 5 = $75. 
To find the saving, we need to subtract the initial cost from the cost at the store.  So, 75 - 65 = 10.  The answer is 10.

[EXP] 104: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2450, [output]:  Helga dances for 5 minutes.  For 3 minutes, her foot tapping rate is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.  For 2 minutes, her foot tapping rate is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.  So her total taps would be (550 * 3) + (400 * 2).  This is 1650 + 800 = 2450.  The answer is 2450. 
 Let's break this down into two parts.  

Helga taps her feet for 3 minutes with her arms down and 2 minutes with her arms up.  When her arms are down, her feet tap at a combined rate of 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.  For 3 minutes, she taps her feet 3 x 550 = 1650 times. 

When her arms are up, her feet tap at a combined rate of 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.  For 2 minutes, she taps her feet 2 x 400 = 800 times. 

So, in total, she taps her feet 1650 + 800 = 2450 times.  The answer is 2450. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step:

* Helga taps her feet for 5 minutes. 
* She raises her arms for 2 of those minutes. 
* When her arms are down, she taps each foot 300 + 250 = 550 times per minute. 
* When her arms are up, she taps each foot 200 times per minute. 
* For 3 minutes, her arms are down, so she taps her feet 3 x 550 = 1650 times. 
* For 2 minutes, her arms are up, so she taps her feet 2 x 2 x 200 = 800 times. 
* The total number of taps is 1650 + 800 = 2450. 

The answer is 2450. 
 Helga taps her right and left foot at a rate of 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.  For 3 minutes, she taps at this rate, so that is 3 x 550 = 1650 taps.  Then, for 2 minutes, the rate slows down and she taps at 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.  So for 2 minutes, she taps 2 x 400 = 800 times.  1650 + 800 = 2450.  The answer is 2450. 
 Let's break it down:

When Helga's arms are at her sides, her total tap rate is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute per feet.  For 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), her total taps would be 550 * 3 = 1650. 
When her arms are raised, her tap rate is 200 taps per minute per feet, for a total of 400 taps per minute.  For 2 minutes, her total taps would be 400 * 2 = 800. 

The total number of taps is 1650 + 800 = 2450. 
The answer is 2450. 
 Let's break this problem into three parts: the first 3 minutes with her arms at her sides and the last 2 minutes with her arms raised. 

First 3 minutes: With her arms at her sides, the tap rate per minute is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.  In 3 minutes, she would tap a total of 550 x 3 = 1650 times. 

Last 2 minutes: With her arms raised, the tap rate is 200 per minute with each foot, for a total of 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.  In 2 minutes, she would tap a total of 400 x 2 = 800 times. 

The combined total number of taps would be 1650 + 800 = 2450.  The answer is 2450. 
 Helga starts with 5 minutes of dancing.  She does this with her arms raised for 2 minutes.  So that means she did her arms lowered for 3 minutes.  With arms lowered, she taps at a rate of 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute with both feet.  So in 3 minutes she would tap 550 * 3 = 1650 times.  With arms raised, she taps at a rate of 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute with both feet.  So in 2 minutes she would tap 400 * 2 = 800 times.  Total she taps 1650 + 800 = 2450 times.  The answer is 2450. 
300 taps per minute with her right foot and 250 taps per minute with her left foot gives us a combined rate of 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.  She dances for 3 minutes with her arms at her sides.  So she taps her feet 3 * 550 = 1650 times.  Then she raises her arms for 2 minutes, so for the remaining 2 minutes, she taps her feet at a rate of 200 taps per minute each.  2 * 200 = 400 taps per minute.  400 * 2 is 800.  So she taps her feet 800 times with her arms raised.  In total, she taps her feet 1650 + 800 = 2450 times.  The answer is 2450. 
 Helga taps at 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute with both hands down.  So after 3 minutes, she will tap a total of 3 * 550 = 1650 times with both hands down.  With her arms up, she taps at 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.  She does this for only 2 minutes, so she taps 2 * 400 = 800 times with her arms up.  The total combined number of times Helga taps both feet is 1650 + 800 = 2450.  The answer is 2450. 
 Helga is taping her feet with two different rates, one for her right foot and one for her left.  While her arms are at her sides, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute, and her left foot at 250 taps per minute.  So together, she taps 300 + 250 = 550 times per minute.  She does this for 3 minutes.  550 x 3 = 1650.  Then she raises her arms, and she taps at 200 taps per minute with each foot.  Together, she taps 200 + 200 = 400 times per minute.  She does this for 2 minutes.  400 x 2 = 800.  1650 + 800 = 2450.  The answer is 2450. 
 Helga has 3 modes of tapping feet: With her arms down, 300 taps with her right foot and 250 taps with her left foot, so 300 + 250 = 550 taps in 1 minute.  Then, with her arms up, 200 taps with each foot, 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. 

She danced for 5 minutes.  For 3 minutes, she had her arms down, which is 3 * 550 = 1650 taps.  For 2 minutes, she had her arms up, which is 2 * 400 = 800 taps.  So the total taps is 1650 + 800 = 2450.  The answer is 2450. 
 Let's break this down into parts. 

First, when her arms are at her sides, she taps her right foot 300 times per minute and her left foot 250 times per minute.  In one minute, she taps both feet 300 + 250 = 550 times. 

She does this for 3 minutes, so in those minutes, she taps both feet a total of 3 * 550 = 1650 times. 

Then, she raises her arms and taps both feet at 200 times per minute each, for 2 minutes.  During these 2 minutes, she taps her feet a total of 2 * 200 * 2 = 800 times. 

Adding these together, we have 1650 + 800 = 2450.  The answer is 2450. 
 Helga taps 300 + 250 taps per minute when her hands are down.  That is 550 taps per minute.  The amount of time when her hands were down is 5 - 2 = 3 minutes.  So she taps her feet a total of 3 * 550 = 1650 times when her hands are down. 

At the other times, she taps 200 + 200 = 400 times a minute.   She is doing that for 2 minutes.  400 * 2 = 800 times she taps her feet when her hands are raised. 

The total number of times she taps her feet is 1650 + 800 = 2450.  The answer is 2450. 
 Voted result: [' Helga dances for 5 minutes.  For 3 minutes, her foot tapping rate is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.  For 2 minutes, her foot tapping rate is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.

15 + 45 = 60 spools of blue thread.  The total number of spools is 60 + 40 + 50 = 150.  Percent of blue spools is 60/150 = 0. 4.  Converting to percent, 0. 4 is 40%.  The answer is 40%. 
15 light blue spools, 45 dark blue spools are 15 + 45 = 60 blue spools.  The total number of spools are 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.  The number of blue spools as a percentage is (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%.  The answer is 40%. 
 Let's first find the total number of spools of thread Candy has:

15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, let's count the blue spools:

15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

So, the total number of blue spools is 60.  To find what percent of the spools are blue, divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100:

(60 blue spools / 150 total spools) x 100 = 40%

The answer is 40%. 
45 dark blue spools and 15 light blue spools makes a total of 45 + 15 = 60 blue spools.  The total number of spools is 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.  To find the percentage, we can divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100. 

60 blue spools / 150 total spools = 0. 4
0. 4 x 100 = 40

So, 40 percent of Candy's spools are blue.  The answer is 40. 
15 + 45 is 60 blue spools out of the total 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools.  To convert this to a percentage, divide 60 by 150 and multiply by 100.  (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%.  The answer is 40%. 
15 + 45 = 60 are blue.  To find what percent of the total spools are blue, we need to divide 60 by the total number of spools and multiply by 100. 

60 / (15 + 45 + 40 + 50) = 60 / 150 = 0. 4 × 100 = 40

The answer is 40.

The answer is 40%. 
15 + 45 = 60.  These are the blue spools of thread.  60 is out of 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.  We calculate 60/150 as a percentage, which is 40.  The answer is 40. 
 There are a total of 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools of thread.  The number of blue spools of thread is 15 + 45 = 60.  60 out of 150 is 60/150.  To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100.  60/150 x 100 = 40.  So 40% of the spools are blue.  The answer is 40%. 
 Let's first find the total number of spools of thread she has:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

She has 150 spools of thread in total.  Now, let's find the number of blue spools:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

There are 60 blue spools.  To find the percentage of blue spools, we can divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100:

(60 / 150) x 100 = 40%

So, 40% of her spools are blue.  The answer is 40%. 
 First, we need to find out how many blue spools of thread Candy has.  She has 15 + 45 = 60 blue spools. 

Next, we need to find the number of total spools she has.  15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools. 

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools:

60 blue spools / 150 total spools = 0. 4 = 40%

The answer is 40%. 
 Let's first calculate the total number of spools.  
15 light blue spools + 45 dark blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60 blue spools
40 light green spools + 50 dark green spools = 40 + 50 = 90 green spools
Total spools = blue spools + green spools = 60 + 90 = 150 spools

Now, let's calculate the percentage of blue spools:
Number of blue spools = 60
Total spools = 150
Percentage of blue spools = (Number of blue spools ÷ Total spools) x 100 = (60 ÷ 150) x 100 = 40%

The answer is 40. 
15 + 45 = 60 spools of blue thread.  
Total number of spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150
Spools of blue thread are 60.  So percent of blue spools = (60/150) * 100.  The answer is 40%. 
 Let's first find the total number of blue spools of thread.  The total number of blue spools is 45 (dark blue) + 15 (light blue) = 60.  The total number of spools is 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150.  Then, to find the percentage of blue spools, first divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools: 60 ÷ 150 = 0. 4.  Finally, multiply by 100 to get the percentage: 0. 4 x 100 = 40.  The answer is 40. 
 The total number of spools of thread is 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150. 
 
To find the number of blue spools, we add the light blue (15) and dark blue (45) spools: 15 + 45 = 60. 
 
The percent of blue spools is the number of blue spools divided by the total, multiplied by 100.  So we have 60/150 * 100 = 40%. 
 
The answer is 40. 
15 + 45 is 60.  60 out of 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 are blue.  Let's convert 60 into a percent.  There are 60/150 parts out of the total 150 that are blue, so the percent is 60/150 * 100 = 40%.  The answer is 40%. 
15 light blue spools and 45 dark blue spools make a total of 15 + 45 = 60 blue spools.  Adding light blue and dark green spools, we also have 40 + 50 = 90 non-blue spools.  So 60 out of 60 + 90 = 150 total spools are blue.  To find the percentage, divide 60 by 150 and multiply by 100 to convert to percentage: 60/150 = 0. 4 which is 40%.  The answer is 40%. 
45 dark blue spools of thread and 15 light blue spools of thread add up to a total of 45 + 15 = 60 spools of blue thread.  60 out of the 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 spools is the same as 60 out of 150 spools.  We want to find the percentage, which is "part over whole".  So we divide 60 by 150 and multiply by 100: (60/150) x 100 = 40%.  The answer is 40%.

20% of 100 votes is 20.  Candidate B got 50% more, or 50/100 * 20 = 10 votes more than candidate A, so B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.  The total number of votes is 20 + 30 + C = 100.  So C must get 50 votes.  The answer is 50. 
100 voters were voting.  Candidate A got 20% of the votes.  That's 20 votes (20% of 100).  Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A.  20 + 50% of 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.  So candidate B got 30 votes.  The rest of the votes went to candidate C.  100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.  The answer is 50. 
20% of the votes means 100 x 0. 2 = 20 votes.  Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, so 20 + 20 x 0. 5 = 30 votes.  Total votes for A and B are 20 + 30 = 50 votes.  The total number of votes is 100.  Candidate C got the rest, 100 - 50 = 50 votes.  The answer is 50. 
20% of the votes means 0. 2 * 100 = 20 votes for candidate A.  Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A.  So 20 + 20 x 0. 5 = 20 + 10 = 30 votes for candidate B.  20 + 30 = 50 votes for candidate A and B combined.  There are 100 voters total and 50 votes for A and B.  100 - 50 = 50 votes left for candidate C.  The answer is 50. 
20% of 100 votes equals 20 votes, as 20% can be written as 1/5 or 0. 2, and 100 * 0. 2 = 20.  If candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A, then he got 20 + 20 * 0. 5 = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.  Candidate B got 30 votes.  Candidate A got 20 votes and candidate B got 30.  That means candidate C got the rest of the votes.  The total number of votes is 100, and 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

[EXP] 107: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]: 80 students in two classes is 80 / 2 = 40 students in each class.  Since 40% are girls, the remaining 60% are boys.  60% of 40 is 0. 6 x 40 = 24.  The answer is 24 boys. 
80 students are in total.  40% of the students are girls, so 60% of the students are boys.  60% of 80 is 48, so each class has 24 boys.  The answer is 24. 
80 students in total.  If each class has the same number of students, they each have 80 / 2 = 40 students.  40% of the students are girls, which is 0. 4 * 40 = 16 girls in each class.  To find the number of boys, subtract the number of girls from the total number of students: 40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.  The answer is 24. 
2 classes have 80 students, so each class has 80 / 2 = 40 students.  40% of the students are girls and 100% - 40% = 60% are boys.  60% of 40 is 60/100 \* 40 = 0. 6 x 40 = 24.  The answer is 24. 
80 is the total number of students in both classes.  If each class has the same amount of students, then it's 80 ÷ 2 = 40 students in each class. 

In each class, 40% of the students are girls.  To find the number of girls, we multiply the number of students in each class by 40%:

40 (students) x 0. 4 = 16 girls

To find the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students:

40 (students) - 16 (girls) = 24 boys

So, there are 24 boys in each class.  The answer is 24. 
2 classes in total with 80 students.  So each class has 80 / 2 = 40 students. 

40 students in each class.  40% are girls.  That means 100% - 40% = 60% are boys. 

60% of 40 students is 40 x (60 / 100) = 24 students. 

The answer is 24. 
80 students in total, each class the same, so let's say each class has x students.  x + x = 80, so 2x = 80, x = 40.  Each class has 40 students. 

Now, 40% of the students are girls.  So, in each class, 0. 4x = 0. 4 * 40 = 16 students are girls.  So, in each class, 40 - 16 = 24 students are boys. 

The answer is 24. 
80 students total are evenly divided between the two classes, so there must be 80 / 2 = 40 students in each class. 

Let's call the number of boys in each class x.  The number of girls in each class is 40% of the class size, which is 0. 4 * 40 = 16 girls. 

The total number of students in each class is 40, so the number of boys is the total number of students minus the number of girls: 40 - 16 = 24. 

The answer is 24. 
80 students are in total, with each class having the same amount of students.  So each class must have half of the total students, which is 80/2 = 40.  Now, 40% of the students are girls in each class, which means 100% - 40% = 60% are boys.  60% of 40 students in each class are 0. 6 * 40 = 24.  The answer is 24. 
 Since there are 80 students in total, and each class has the same number of students, let's split the 80 students into two classes of x students each.  80 = 2x, so x = 40.  Now we know that each class has 40 students.  40% of the students in each class are girls.  40% of 40 = 0. 4 x 40 = 16.  So there are 16 girls in each class.  If there are 16 girls in each class, there must be 40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.  The answer is 24. 
80 students are split between two equal classes.  So each class has 80 / 2 = 40 students. 
40% of the students are girls.  40% can be written as a decimal as 0. 4.  0. 4 x 40 = 16, which means that 16 girls are in each class. 
If 16 girls are in each class, then there are 40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.  The answer is 24. 
80 students in total between 2 classes.  Each class has the same number of students, so each class has x students.  So 2x = 80.  Divide both sides by 2 to get x = 40.  So each class has 40 students. 

Since 40% of the students are girls, the number of girls in each class is 40% of 40, or 0. 40 x 40 = 16.  So in each class, there are 16 girls. 

There are 40 students in each class, and 16 are girls.  Therefore, each class has 40 - 16 = 24 boys. 

The answer is 24 boys in each class. 
 In each class, 40% are girls, so 60% are boys.  Let's say the number of students in each class is x.  Then, the total number of boys in one class would be 0. 6x. 

The total number of students in both classes is 80, and since each class has the same number of students, the number of students in each class is x.  The total number of boys in both classes is the sum of the number of boys in each class, which is 0. 6x + 0. 6x = 1. 2x. 

The total number of boys in both classes is equal to the total number of students minus the total number of girls, which is 80 - 0. 4x - 0. 4x = 80 - 0. 8x.  Since we know that the total number of boys is 1. 2x, we can set up the equation 1. 2x = 80 - 0. 8x and solve for x. 

To solve for x, we can add 0. 8x to both sides of the equation to get 1. 2x + 0. 8x = 80, which simplifies to 2x = 80.  Then, we can divide both sides by 2 to get x = 40. 

So, there are 40 students in each class.  The number of boys in each class is 0. 6x, which is 0. 6(40) = 24.  The answer is 24. 
80 students are in the two classes.  Each class has the same number of students.  Let's call this number x.  So, we can write the problem as 2x = 80.  To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2, so x = 80 / 2.  80 / 2 = 40.  So each class has 40 students. 

Now, we know that 40% of each class is girls.  The total number of students in each class is 40, and 40% of 40 is 0. 4 * 40 = 16.  So there are 16 girls in each class. 

This means there are 40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.  The answer is 24. 
80 students in total, and each class has the same amount of students.  So if we find out the number of students in each class, we can find the number of boys in each class.  First, 40% of the students in each class are girls, so 60% are boys.  

Let's say each class has x students.  The total is 80, so x + x = 80.  Simplified, 2x = 80.  Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 40.  So each class has 40 students. 

Now we know each class has 40 students, and 60% are boys.  60 percent of 40 is (40 * 0. 6) = 24.  So there are 24 boys in each class.  The answer is 24. 
 Let's first calculate the total number of girls in both classes.  Since each class has the same number of students, we can start by finding the number of girls in one class.  There are 40% girls, so the number of girls in one class is 40% of x, where x is the number of students in one class.  This can be written as 0. 4x. 

Since we know there are 80 students in total, the total number of students in one class is half of 80, which is 40.  So, x = 40. 

The number of girls in one class is 0. 4x, which is 16. 

Since there are 80 students in total, the number of girls in the other class is also 16. 

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.  In one class, there are 40 students and 16 are girls, so the number of boys is 40 - 16 = 24. 

Since each class has the same number of students, the number of boys in each class is the same, which is 24. 

The answer is 24. 
80 students total.  2 classes, each with the same amount of students.  So, let's say class A has x and class B has x. 
Total students = x + x = 80
To solve for x, subtract 80 from both sides. 
x + x = 80
2x = 80
Divide both sides by 2
x = 40

Now we know each class has 40 students.  We also know that 40% of the students in each class are girls.  So, to find the number of boys, subtract 40% of the class. 
40% of 40 = 0. 4 x 40 = 16
Number of girls in each class = 0. 4 x 40 = 16
Number of boys in each class = 40 - 16 = 24

The answer is 24.

", "80 students are in the two classes.  Each class has the same number of students.  Let's call this number x.  So, we can write the problem as 2x = 80.  To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2, so x = 80 / 2.  80 / 2 = 40.  So each class has 40 students. \n\nNow, we know that 40% of each class is girls.  The total number of students in each class is 40, and 40% of 40 is 0. 4 * 40 = 16.  So there are 16 girls in each class. \n\nThis means there are 40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.  The answer is 24. ", "80 students in total, and each class has the same amount of students.  So if we find out the number of students in each class, we can find the number of boys in each class.  First, 40% of the students in each class are girls, so 60% are boys.  \n\nLet's say each class has x students.  The total is 80, so x + x = 80.  Simplified, 2x = 80.  Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 40.  So each class has 40 students. \n\nNow we know each class has 40 students, and 60% are boys.  60 percent of 40 is (40 * 0. 6) = 24.  So there are 24 boys in each class.  The answer is 24. ", " Let's first calculate the total number of girls in both classes.  Since each class has the same number of students, we can start by finding the number of girls in one class.  There are 40% girls, so the number of girls in one class is 40% of x, where x is the number of students in one class.  This can be written as 0. 4x. \n\nSince we know there are 80 students in total, the total number of students in one class is half of 80, which is 40.  So, x = 40. \n\nThe number of girls in one class is 0. 4x, which is 16. \n\nSince there are 80 students in total, the number of girls in the other class is also 16. \n\nTo find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.  In one class, there are 40 students and 16 are girls, so the number of boys is 40 - 16 = 24. \n\nSince each class has the same number of students, the number of boys in each class is the same, which is 24. \n\nThe answer is 24. ", "80 students total.  2 classes, each with the same amount of students.  So, let's say class A has x and class B has x. \nTotal students = x + x = 80\nTo solve for x, subtract 80 from both sides. \nx + x = 80\n2x = 80\nDivide both sides by 2\nx = 40\n\nNow we know each class has 40 students.  We also know that 40% of the students in each class are girls.  So, to find the number of boys, subtract 40% of the class. \n40% of 40 = 0. 4 x 40 = 16\nNumber of girls in each class = 0. 4 x 40 = 16\nNumber of boys in each class = 40 - 16 = 24\n\nThe answer is 24.

54 students are to be separated into 6 groups.  Each group has 54 / 6 = 9 students.  Now the activity needs 12 groups.  But only 6 are available.  So 12 - 6 = 6 more groups are needed.  The answer is 6. 
54 students are to be divided into 6 groups.  For each group, that is 54 / 6 = 9 students.  Since there are only 6 groups, but the activity requires 12 groups, there are 12 - 6 = 6 more groups needed.  The answer is 6. 
54 students need to be separated into six groups.  In each group, 54 / 6 = 9 students.  However, we need 12 groups, not 6.  12 - 6 = 6.  So, we need 6 more groups.  The answer is 6. 
54 students are to be separated into 6 equal groups.  Let's calculate how many students each group should have: 54 ÷ 6 = 9 students per group.  Now, the activity requires 12 groups, but we only have 6 groups.  To find out how many more groups are needed, subtract 6 from 12: 12 - 6 = 6.  So, 6 more groups are needed.  The answer is 6. 
54 students are to be separated into 6 groups.  Since there are 54 students, each group will have 54 / 6 = 9 students.  But the activity requires 12 groups.

54 students need to be separated into 6 groups.  This means each group should have 54 / 6 = 9 students.  Then, they need 12 groups for the activity.  So, we need to know how many more groups are needed to form.  Currently, we have 6 groups, so we need to form 12 - 6 = 6 more groups.  The answer is 6. 
54 students are to be separated into 6 groups.  That means one group will have 54 / 6 = 9 students.  Now, for 12 groups, we need 9 * 12 = 108 students.  Since we only have 54 students, we will need 108 - 54 = 54 students.  

Since each new group needs 9 students and we need 54 students, we will need 54 / 9 = 6 groups.  The answer is 6. 
54 students are to be separated into 6 groups.  That means that each group should have 54 / 6 = 9 students.  We need to form 12 groups.  Since each group should have 9 students, we need to find out how many groups of 9 can be made out of 54.  Since 9 * 6 = 54, that means 6 groups can be made.  So for 12 groups, we need to make 12 - 6 = 6 more groups.  The answer is 6. 
54 students need to be divided into 6 groups.  To find the size of each group, we divide 54 by 6: 54 / 6 = 9. 

To form 12 groups, each group will have 54 / 12 = 9 students.  Originally, we already have 6 groups, so we need to find how many more groups we need to have 12 groups.  Since each group has 9 students, we can find the total number of students in the existing groups: 6 groups x 9 students per group = 54 students. 

The total number of students is still 54, so the number of students left to be grouped remains the same.  We will need an additional 12 - 6 = 6 groups to form 12 groups.  The answer is 6. 
54 students are to be separated into 6 groups.  So each group would have 54 / 6 = 9 students.  Now, there are a total of 12 groups required.  So the difference is 12 - 6 = 6.  We do not need to know how many students are in each group, only that we have 6 more groups to form.  The answer is 6.

[EXP] 109: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]: 33 people are on the council.  Let's represent the number of votes against the regulation as "x".  Then the number of votes in favor of the regulation will be 2x. 

The total number of votes is 33, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

So there were 11 votes against the regulation.  Since there were twice as many votes in favor, the number of votes in favor is:

2x = 2(11) = 22

The answer is 22. 
33 people voted.  The number of votes in favor of the regulation is twice the number of votes against the regulation.  Let's say the number of votes against the regulation is x.  Then, the number of votes in favor of the regulation is 2x.  The sum of the votes against and in favor of the regulation is 33.  So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide by 3:

x = 11

So, there were 11 votes against the regulation.  Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is:

2x = 2(11) = 22

The answer is 22. 
33 is the total number of votes.  There were twice as many votes in favor as there were against.  Let's say x is the number of votes against the new regulation.  Then the number of votes in favor is 2x.  The total number of votes is the sum of the votes against and the votes in favor: x + 2x = 33.  Combine like terms: 3x = 33.  Divide both sides by 3: x = 11.  So there were 11 votes against the new regulation.  Then the number of votes in favor is 2x = 2 * 11 = 22.  The answer is 22. 
33 people are on the council, and 33 is the total number of votes.  Let x be the number of votes against the regulation.  Then, the number of votes in favor of the regulation is 2x.  Since the total number of votes is 33, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

So, there were 11 votes against the regulation.  Since the number of votes in favor of the regulation is twice the number of votes against it, the number of votes in favor is:

2x = 2(11) = 22

The answer is 22. 
 There are 33 people on the council.  For the vote, there are X votes against the regulation and 2X votes in favor.  The total number of votes is 33.  So X + 2X = 33.  Combine like terms to get 3X = 33.  Divide both sides by 3 to get X = 11.  This means there are 11 votes against the regulation and 2X = 2(11) = 22 votes in favor.  The answer is 22. 
33 people are on the council.  There were the same number of votes against the new regulation as the difference between the total votes and the votes in favor, which is 33/3 = 11.  So the number of votes against the new regulation is 11.  Then the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2 * 11 = 22.  The answer is 22. 
33 people on the council.  The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is TWICE the number of votes against it.  Let's call the number of votes against it "x".  Then, the number of votes in favor is 2x.  Since there are 33 people on the council, the total number of votes is 33.  The sum of the votes for and against the regulation is 33:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide by 3:

x = 11

The number of votes against the regulation is 11.  Since the number of votes in favor is twice this, the number of votes in favor is:

2x = 2(11) = 22

The answer is 22. 
33 people are on the council.  If the votes were equal, 1/3 would be against the regulation and 2/3 would be in favor.  33 divided by 3 is 11.  So 11 votes would be against.  This means 2 * 11 = 22 votes would be in favor.  The answer is 22. 
33 people are on the council.  Say x is the number of people who voted against the regulation.  Then 2x is the number of people who voted for the regulation.  Then, we have the equation x + 2x = 33.  3x = 33.  x = 11.  There are 11 people who voted against the regulation.  So there are 2 * 11 = 22 people who voted for the regulation.  The answer is 22. 
33 people on the council.  Let's assume the number of votes against the new regulation is "x".  Then the number of votes in favor of the new regulation would be 2x, because it's twice as many.  The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is x + 2x = 3x.  We know the total number of votes is 33, so we set up the equation 3x = 33.  To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3, getting x = 11.  Since the number of votes in favor is 2x, we multiply x by 2 to get the answer: 2x = 2(11) = 22.  The answer is 22. 
33 people were on the council.  The vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against.  So the number of votes against it is x.  The number of votes in favor is 2x.  The total number of votes is 3x, because x + 2x = 3x.  Since there are 33 people total, 3x = 33, so x = 11.  If x = 11, then 2x, the number of votes in favor, is 2*11 = 22.  The answer is 22. 
33 people are on the council.  The number of votes against the regulation is unknown.  Let's call it x.  If there are twice as many votes in favor as against, then the number of votes in favor is 2x. 

The total number of votes is the sum of the number of votes in favor and against: 2x + x = 3x. 

The total number of votes is also the total number of people on the council, which is 33: 3x = 33. 

To solve for x, divide both sides by 3: x = 33/3 = 11. 

Now, we know that the number of votes against the regulation is 11.  The number of votes in favor is twice that, which is 2x = 2(11) = 22. 

The answer is 22. 
33 is the total number of people on the council.  The number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against.  Let's say the number of votes against is x.  Then the number of votes in favor is 2x.  The total number of votes (in favor and against) is the sum of the two: x + 2x = 33.  This can be simplified to 3x = 33.  Now we need to divide both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 33 / 3 = 11.  So there were 11 votes against the regulation.  The number of votes in favor is twice this amount, so 2x = 2(11) = 22.  The answer is 22. 
33 is the total number of council members.  Let's say the number of votes against the regulation is x.  Then, the number of votes in favor of the regulation would be 2x, because it is said that there are twice as many votes in favor as there are against. 

The total number of votes would be the sum of the votes against and the votes in favor: x + 2x = 3x. 

We know that the total number of members is 33, so we can set up the equation: 3x = 33. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 11. 

This means that there were 11 votes against the regulation.  The number of votes in favor of the regulation would then be 2x = 2(11) = 22. 

The answer is 22. 
33 people on the council, twice as many voted for as against, let's say votes against = A.  Then votes for = A * 2.  The total votes cast = votes for + votes against = A * 2 + A = 3A.  Since there are 33 people, 3A = 33.  So, A = 11.  If A is 11, then votes for = A * 2 = 11 * 2 = 22.  The answer is 22. 
33 people on the council means 33 voters.  The vote passed with twice as many votes for as against.  This is written as a math equation: 2x + x = 33, where x is the number of votes against.  3x = 33.  To solve for x, divide both sides by 3: x = 33 / 3 = 11.  The number of votes against is 11.  The number of votes for is twice this: 11 x 2 = 22.  The answer is 22. 
33 people on the council.  Twice as many voted for the new regulation as against it.  This means that the number of votes against the regulation is equal to 1/3rd of the total.  The number of votes in favor will be the rest, which is the remaining 2/3rd.  So, the number of votes against is 33 * 1/3 = 11.  And the number of votes in favor will be 33 * 2/3 = 22.  The answer is 22. 
 Let's start by finding the total number of votes.  Let x be the number of votes against the regulation.  Then, the number of votes in favor of the regulation is 2x, since it says there are twice as many votes in favor as against.  The total number of votes is the sum of the votes against and in favor, or x + 2x.  However, this total is equal to the total number of council members, which is 33.  We can set up an equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of votes in favor of the regulation.  Since there are twice as many votes in favor as against, the number of votes in favor is 2x, which is:

2(11) = 22

So, there were 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.  The answer is 22. 
33 is the total number of people on the council.  The number of votes in favor of the new regulation was equal to the number of votes against it, times 2.  Let's say the number of votes against the regulation is x.  Then, the number of votes in favor of the regulation would be 2x.  Since there are 33 people, the total number of votes (both for and against) is the sum of the two: x + 2x = 3x. 

The total number of votes is equal to the number of people on the council, which is 33.  So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 33

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 33 / 3

x = 11

Since x is the number of votes against the regulation, and there are twice as many votes in favor, the number of votes in favor is 2x = 2(11) = 22. 

The answer is 22. 
33 people on the council.  The vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as against.  So if there were a and against votes against the new regulation, then 2(x) in favor of the new regulation.  So the total number of votes is a + 2(a) = 33.  The sum of a + 2(a) is 3(a).  This equation becomes 3(a) = 33.  Divide both sides by 3 to get a = 11.  So there were 11 votes against.  Since there are twice as many votes in favor, there were 11 x 2 = 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.  The answer is 22. 
33 people voted in the council.  If there were twice as many in favor as opposed, then for every 1 vote against, there were 2 votes in favor.  The total number of votes in favor plus opposed equals 33, which is the number of people in the council. 

If the number of votes opposed is x, then 2x is the number of votes in favor.  The total number of votes, which is the sum of the votes in favor and opposed, is:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

x is the number of votes opposed.  Since there were twice as many votes in favor, the number of votes in favor is:

2x = 2 * 11 = 22

So the number of votes in favor of the new regulation was 22.  The answer is 22. 
33 is the total number of council members.  If the vote passed and the number of votes in favor was twice the number of votes against, then we can pretend that the council members voted as follows: a certain number x against, and 2x in favor.  This means that 2x + x = 33, because it's a total of 33 votes.  We can simplify this by combining the x terms: 3x = 33.  Now, to solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3: x = 33 / 3 = 11.  So, 11 council members voted against, and 11 x 2 = 22 council members voted in favor.  The answer is 22.

[EXP] 110: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Since the first house needing 1/2 of the second, that means the second house needs 2 times the first house.  And since the third house needs double the first, that means it needs 2 times the first. 

Let's call the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house x.  Then, the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house would be 2x, and the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house would be 2x. 

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250.  So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 2x = 250

Combine like terms:

5x = 250

Divide by 5:

x = 50

So, the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house is 50. 

The number of cases of shingles needed for the second house is 2x, which is 2(50) = 100. 

The number of cases of shingles needed for the third house is 2x, which is 2(50) = 100. 

The answer is 100. 
250 is the total number of cases of shingles.  Let's start with the first house.  The first house needs x cases of shingles.  The second house needs 2x cases of shingles.  The third house needs twice the first, so it needs 2x cases.  The sum of the three is x + 2x + 2x = 250.  This simplifies to 5x = 250.  So x = 50.  The third house needs 2x = 2 * 50 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
 Let's start by assigning variables to represent the number of cases of shingles each house will need. 

Let's say the first house needs x cases. 
The second house needs 2x cases (since it needs 1/2 as many as the first). 
The third house needs 2*x cases (since it needs double the first). 

We know that the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250.  So we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 2*x = 250

Combine like terms:

5x = 250

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 50

So the first house needs 50 cases of shingles. 
The second house needs 2x = 2(50) = 100 cases of shingles. 
The third house needs 2*x = 2(50) = 100 cases of shingles. 

The answer is 100. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 

We know that the total number of cases needed for the three homes is 250.  Let's call the number of cases needed for the first house "x".  Then, the number of cases needed for the second house is 2x (since it's 1/2 of the second house). 

We know that the third house needs twice as many cases as the first house, so it needs 2x cases. 

The total number of cases for the three houses is the sum of the cases needed for each house: x + 2x + 2x = 5x. 

We know that the total number of cases is 250, so we can set up the equation: 5x = 250. 

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 5: x = 50. 

Now that we know x is 50, we can find the number of cases needed for the third house by multiplying x by 2: 2x = 2 * 50 = 100. 

The answer is 100. 
 Let's break this down!

The first house needs x cases. 

The second house needs 2x cases (since it's 2 times the first house). 

The third house needs 2x cases (since it's double the first house). 

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. 

We can set up an equation:

x + 2x + 2x = 250

Combine like terms:

5x = 250

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 50

So, the first house needs 50 cases, the second house needs 100 cases, and the third house needs. 

Double the first house's cases, so that's 100 cases. 

The answer is 100. 
 Since the second house needs half the amount of the second house, let's call the amount needed by the second house "x".  Then the first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs double the first house, which is 2*x cases. 

The total amount needed for the three houses is 250 cases.  So the equation is x/2 + x + 2x = 250. 

Combine like terms: 3x/2 + 2x = 250

Combine the x terms: 5x/2 = 250

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5: x = 100

So the second house needs 100 cases of shingles.  The first house needs half of that, which is 100/2 = 50 cases.  The third house needs double the first house, which is 2*50 = 100 cases. 

The answer is 100. 
250 cases of shingles are needed in total.  We can let x be the amount of shingles needed for the first house.  

According to the problem, the second house will need 2x because it needs half as many shingles as the second.  The third house needs twice as many shingles as the first house. 

So, we have: 
x + 2x + 2x = 250

Combine like terms:
5x = 250

Divide by 5:
x = 50

So, the first house needs 50 cases of shingles.  The second house needs 2x, or 2 x 50, which is 100.  The third house needs 2x, or 2 x 50, which is 100. 

The answer is 100. 
250 cases of shingles are needed for the three homes.  Let's first find out how many cases the second and third houses need.  The first house needs x cases of shingles.  The second house needs 2x (since it's one and a half times as many cases as the first) and the third house needs 2x (since it's double the first house).  Together, the three houses need x + 2x + 2x = 250.  So 5x = 250.  x = 50. 

Now, we need to find the number of cases the third house needs.  The third house needs 2x cases, which is 2 x 50 = 100.  The answer is 100.

[EXP] 112: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4400, [output]:  A third of the movies are in various series.  So the number of series movies is 600 * 1/3 = 200.  The cost of 200 series movies is 200 * 6 = 1200.  The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400.  40% of the remaining movies are older movies, which is 400 * 40% = 160.  The cost of 160 older movies is 160 * 5 = 800.  The cost of the remaining 240 movies is 240 * 10 = 2400.  The total cost is 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400.  The answer is 4400. 
1/3rd of 600 movies are in series, which is (1/3) * 600 = 200 movies.  They cost only $6 each, so that's 200 * 6 = 1200 dollars. 

Remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400 movies.  40% of those are older movies, which is (40/100) * 400 = 160 movies.  Older movies cost $5 each, so that's 160 * 5 = 800 dollars. 

Remaining 400 - 160 = 240 movies are normal movies, which cost $10 each.  So that's 240 * 10 = 2400 dollars. 

Total cost is 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 dollars.  The answer is 4400. 
 Mike has 600 movies.  A third, or 600 / 3 = 200 movies, are in various series.  Since these movies can be bought for $6 each, Mike will spend 200 x 6 = 1200 dollars on these movies. 

The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400 movies.  40% of 400 is 0. 4 x 400 = 160 movies, and these older movies cost $5 each, so Mike will spend 160 x 5 = 800 dollars on these movies. 

All the remaining movies cost the normal $10 each, which is 600 - 200 - 160 = 240 movies.  Mike will spend 240 x 10 = 2400 dollars on these movies. 

In total, Mike will spend 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 dollars.  The answer is 4400. 
60 movies are in various series and can be bought together for 6 dollars each.  1/3 of 600 is 200.  So 200 movies can be bought as part of the series for 200 * 6 = 1200 dollars.  40% of the remaining movies are older and cost 5 dollars each.  600 - 200 is 400.  40% of 400 is 0. 4 * 400 = 160 movies.  These cost 160 * 5 = 800 dollars.  The remaining movies cost 10 dollars each.  The remaining movies are 600 - 200 - 160 = 240 movies.  These cost 240 * 10 = 2400 dollars.  In total, the cost is 1200 + 800 + 2400 dollars.  This is 4400 dollars.  The answer is 4400. 
600 movies.  A third of the movies are in a series.  1/3 * 600 = 200 movies are in a series.  These are $6 each, or 200 * 6 = 1200 dollars.  The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400 movies.  40% of the remaining movies are older movies.  40% * 400 = 160 movies.  These are $5 each or 160 * 5 = 800 dollars.  So the remaining movies are 400 - 160 = 240 movies.  These are normal movies at $10 each, so 240 * 10 = 2400 dollars.  Then there are three types of movies.  The series movies cost 1200 dollars, older movies cost 800 dollars, and normal movies cost 2400 dollars.  To find the total cost, you add these together.  1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400.  The answer is 4400 dollars. 
 Mike starts with 600 movies. 

He wants to replace 1/3 of them because they are in a series.  1/3 of 600 is 600 / 3 = 200.  He gets these at a discounted price of $6 each, so he'll spend 200 x 6 = 1200.  That leaves 400 movies remaining. 

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, which are $5 each.  40% of 400 is (0. 4 x 400) = 160.  He spends 160 x 5 = 800 on these movies. 

The remaining 240 movies are the normal ones.  Since they're $10 each, he spends 240 x 10 = 2400 on these. 

In total, he spends 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400.  The answer is 4400. 
600 movies are originally.  1/3 of them are in a series, so 600/3 = 200 movies are in a series.  
We know that buying the series is 6 dollars for each.  So, buying the series cost 200 x 6 = 1200 dollars. 

The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400 movies.  40% of 400 is 0. 4 x 400 = 160 older movies.  
The cost for 160 older movies is 160 x 5 = 800. 
We have 400 - 160 = 240 movies left.  
The remaining movies cost 240 x 10 = 2400 dollars. 

Total cost of replacing the movies is 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 dollars.  The answer is 4400. 
1/3 of the movies are in various series and can be bought together for $6.  So, 600 * 1/3 = 600/3 = 200 movies will be bought as a series.  The cost for those will be 200 x 6 = 1200. 

Now, 200 movies are left.  40% of the remaining movies are older movies which can be bought for $5.  So, 40% of 400 is 160.  160 movies are old and cost $5.  The cost for those will be 160 x 5 = 800. 

The remaining movies are the normal movies, so 600 - 200 - 160 = 240 movies.  Each of these will be bought for $10, so the total cost will be 240 x 10 = 2400. 

In total, the cost to replace the movies is 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400.  The answer is 4400. 
600 movies are in the collection.  A third (1/3) of 600 is 600/3 = 200.  So 200 are in series.  The rest are not in series, so 400 movies are not in series.  40% of the remaining movies are older movies.  40% of 400 is 40/100 * 400 = 160.  So 160 older movies will be $5 each.  There are 240 remaining movies.  The cost of older movies is 160 * 5 = 800.  A normal movie would have cost 10 each.  They can get the series movies for only $6 each.  So the total cost is (200*6)+800+240*10 = 1200+800+2400.  The result is 4400.  The answer is 4400.

 We have to calculate how many miles Andy drives each week and how much gas he uses, then multiply the two to get total cost. 

A: The distance from work to home and back is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.  This is the distance he drives each day.  5 days * 10 miles = 50 miles.  The number of gallons consumed is 50 / 10 = 5.  Multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon.  5 * 3 = 15.  The answer is 15.

[EXP] 115: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Billy's starting salary is 10 dollars per hour.  After 2 months, he got a raise of 0. 50 dollars per hour.  So his new salary was 10 + 0. 50 = 10. 50 dollars per hour.  After one year, he got another raise of 1 dollar per hour.  So his new salary is 10. 50 + 1 = 11. 50 dollars per hour.  If Sally's starting salary is 0. 50 dollars more than Billy's starting salary, then her starting salary is 10 + 0. 50 = 10. 50 dollars per hour.  After working 20 hours, Billy will make 20 * 11. 50 = 230 dollars.  Sally will make 20 * 10. 50 = 210 dollars.  So Billy will make 230 - 210 = 20 dollars more than Sally.  The answer is 20. 
 Billy's starting salary is 10 dollars per hour.  After 2 months, he earns 10 dollars per hour + $0. 50 = 10. 50 dollars per hour.  On his first anniversary, he earns 10. 50 dollars per hour + $1. 00 = 11. 50 dollars per hour.  In total he earns 20 x 11. 50 = 230 dollars.  Sally's starting salary is 10 dollars per hour + $0. 50 = 10. 50 per hour.  So she earns 20 x 10. 50 = 210 dollars.  Billy earns 230 - 210 = 20 dollars more than Sally.  The answer is 20. 
 Billy was paid $10 per hour originally.  After 2 months, he got a raise of $0. 50 per hour, so his new hourly rate was 10 + 0. 50 = 10. 50 per hour.  Then he got another raise to 10. 50 + 1. 00 = 11. 50 per hour.  

Sally starts at $0. 50 more than Billy's starting rate, so she starts at $10. 50.  For 20 hours of work, Billy makes 20 x 11. 50 = 230.  Sally makes 20 x 10. 50 = 210.  So Billy earns 230 - 210 = 20 dollars more than Sally.  The answer is 20. 
 When Billy was first hired, he made 10 dollars per hour.  After 2 months, he got a $0. 50 increase, so he made 10 + 0. 5 = 10. 5 dollars per hour.  After another month, he got a $1. 00 increase, so he made 10. 5 + 1 = 11. 5 dollars per hour. 

Sally started with a salary that is $0. 50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which is 10 dollars.  So Sally makes 10 + 0. 5 = 10. 5 dollars per hour. 

If both of them work for 20 hours, Billy will make 20 * 11. 5 = 230 dollars.  Sally will make 20 * 10. 5 = 210 dollars.  So Billy will make 230 - 210 = 20 dollars more than Sally. 

The answer is 20. 
 Let's first find Billy's rate per hour after each raise:

- Initially: $10
- After 2 months: $10 + $0. 50 = $10. 50
- On his first anniversary: $10. 50 + $1 = $11. 50

Now, let's calculate Billy's total pay for 20 hours at each rate:

- Initially: 20 * $10 = $200
- After 2 months: 20 * $10. 50 = $210
- On his first anniversary: 20 * $11. 50 = $230

Now, let's find Sally's rate per hour and her total pay for 20 hours:
- Sally's starting salary is $0. 50 more than Billy's starting salary, so it's $10. 50.  After 20 hours, Sally will earn 20 * $10. 50 = $210. 

To find out how much Billy earns more than Sally, subtract Sally's pay from Billy's pay on his first anniversary:
$230 - $210 = $20

The answer is 20. 
 Billy was paid $10 per hour initially.  He got 2 raises, one of $0. 50 and one of $1. 00 per hour.  So his total raise is $1. 00 + $0. 50 = $1. 50.  His total hourly rate will be $10 + $1. 50 = $11. 50.  Sally's starting rate is $0. 50 more than Billy's starting rate, so her starting rate is $10 + $0. 50 = $10. 50.  Billy works 20 hours at $11. 50 per hour.  His total income will be 20 x 11. 50 = 230 dollars.  Sally works 20 hours at $10. 50 per hour.  Her income will be 20 x 10. 50 = 210 dollars.  Billy's income is 230 - 210 = 20 dollars more than Sally.  The answer is 20. 
 Billy was paid $10 per hour initially.  Then after 2 months, he got a raise of $0. 50 per hour.  So he was paid 10 + 0. 5 = 10. 5 dollars per hour.  After that, he got another raise of 1 dollar, so he is paid 10. 5 + 1 = 11. 5 dollars per hour. 

On the other hand, Sally started at $10. 5, since she started $0. 5 more per hour than Billy.  That means she was paid 10. 5 dollars per hour. 

Billy and Sally worked 20 hours.  Billy earned 11. 5 x 20 = 230 dollars.  Sally earned 10. 5 x 20 = 210 dollars.  So Billy earned 230 - 210 = 20 dollars more than Sally.  The answer is 20. 
 Billy's initial rate is 10 dollars per hour.  After the first raise, he earned 0. 50 dollars more per hour.  So 10 + 0. 5 = 10. 5 dollars per hour.  Then, after another raise, his rate became 10. 50 + 1 = 11. 5 dollars per hour. 

So, Sally's starting salary is 10 + 0. 5 = 10. 5 dollars per hour, which is 1 less than Billy's rate. 

Billy earns 11. 5 x 20 = 230 dollars. 
Sally earns 10. 5 x 20 = 210 dollars. 

To find out how much more Billy earns, subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's: 230 - 210 = 20. 

The answer is 20. 
 Billy started with 10 dollars per hour.  After one month, he gets 0. 50 per hour more, so that is 10. 50 dollars per hour.  After another month, he gets 1 more dollar per hour, so that is 11. 50 per hour.  This means that in 20 hours, Billy will earn 20 x 11. 50 = 230 dollars. 


Sally's starting salary is 0. 50 more than Billy's starting salary, so that is 10. 50.  She earns 10. 50 per hour.  20 hours at 10. 50 per hour is 20 * 10. 50 = 210. 


The difference between what Billy and Sally earn is 230 - 210 = 20 dollars.  The answer is 20. 
 First, calculate Billy's hourly rate.  He earns $10 initially.  2 months later, he gets a raise of $0. 50 per hour.  10 + 0. 50 = 10. 50.  On his first anniversary, he gets a raise of $1. 00 per hour.  10. 50 + 1 = 11. 50.  Billy earns $11. 50 per hour now. 

Billy works 20 hours.  So he earns 11. 50 x 20 = $230. 

Sally starts at a rate of $10. 00 + $0. 50 = $10. 50, which is the same hourly rate Billy earns before his first raise.   Therefore, Sally earns $10. 50 x 20 = $210. 

Since Billy earns $230 and Sally earns $210, Billy will earn $230 - $210 = $20 more. 

The answer is 20.

600 + 300 = 900.  A 30% premium on 900 would be 0. 3 * 900 = 270.  So James paid 900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
600 + 300 = 900.  Then he adds a 30% premium.  To find the premium, multiply 900 by 0. 30, which is 270.  900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
 The ring costs the diamond price + the gold price, which is 600 + 300 = 900.  The premium is 30% of the total cost, which is 0. 3 x 900 = 270.  So the total cost is 900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
 The total cost of the diamond and gold is 600 + 300 = 900 dollars.  A 30% premium means 30% of 900 is added to the total.  30% of 900 is 0. 3 * 900 = 270.  So the total amount paid is 900 + 270 = 1170 dollars.  The answer is 1170. 
 The cost of the diamond and the gold is 600 + 300 = 900.   The premium is 30% of 900, so 0. 3 x 900 = 270.  The total amount James paid is 900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
600 dollars for the diamond and 300 dollars for the gold makes 600 + 300 = 900 dollars.  A 30% premium must be added to this price.  30% of 900 is 0. 30 * 900 = 270.  900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
 James originally spent 600 dollars on the diamond and 300 dollars on the gold.  So he spent 600 + 300 = 900 dollars total.  He then had to pay a 30% premium.  30% of 900 is 0. 30 x 900 = 270.  So he paid a premium of 270 dollars.  900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
 James buys the diamond for 600 dollars and the gold for 300 dollars.  So the total cost of the ring is 600 + 300 = 900 dollars.  Since he pays a 30% premium, he pays 30% of 900 = 0. 3 * 900 = 270 dollars.  The total amount he pays is 900 + 270 = 1170 dollars.  The answer is 1170 dollars. 
600 + 300 = 900.  This is the total cost before the premium.  Since he pays 30% more, the total cost will be 1. 3 times the original cost, which is 1. 3 x 900 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
600 is the cost of the diamond and 300 is the cost of the gold.  This means the total cost of the ring is 600 + 300 = 900.  For a 30% premium, 30% of 900 = 0. 3 * 900 = 270.  So he paid 900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
600 + 300 is the cost of the ring, which is 900.  Then there is a 30% premium for it to be made.  A 30% premium means it's 1. 3 times the cost.  900 * 1. 3 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
 First, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold to get the total cost of the ring. 
$600 + $300 = $900

Then, we need to calculate the 30% premium. 

30% of $900 = 0. 30 x $900 = $270

The premium is $270.  To find the total cost, we add the premium to the total cost of the ring. 

$900 + $270 = $1170

James paid $1170.  The answer is 1170. 
600 + 300 = 900.  A 30% premium means the maker will take 30% of the price and add it back to the total price.  30% of 900 is 30/100 * 900 = 270.  The total price is 900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
1) Calculate the total cost of the ring without the premium.  600 + 300 = 900.  2) Calculate 30% of 900.  30% = 0. 3, so 0. 3 x 900 = 270.  3) The premium is 270 dollars, so we add that to the original cost.  900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
 James needs to buy a ring.  The ring consists of a diamond and gold, which cost $600 and $300, respectively.  So the total cost of the ring is 600 + 300 = 900 dollars.  He also pays a 30% premium.  A 30% increase from 900 dollars will be 0. 30 x 900 = 270.  900 + 270 is 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
 James has to pay for the diamond ring.  The diamond is 600 and the gold is 300.  So the total value of the ring is 600 + 300 = 900.  A 30% premium means he needs to pay 30% of 900 dollars more.  30% of 900 is 30/100 * 900 = 270.  So James pays 270 more.  900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
 The ring originally cost $600 + $300 = $900.  The premium is 30% of $900.  30% is the same as . 3 in decimal.  So the premium is $900 x . 3 = $270.  Then the total cost, which James paid, is $900 + $270 = $1170.  The answer is 1170. 
 James had to pay for the diamond ($600) and the gold ($300), so the total cost before the premium was 600 + 300 = 900.  He paid a 30% premium on 900.  To find 30% of 900, multiply 900 by 0. 30.  0. 30 x 900 = 270.  270 is the premium.  The total cost includes the premium, so the total cost is 900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
 The ring cost originally $600 for the diamond and $300 for the gold.  That is a total of 600 + 300 = 900 dollars.  James has to pay a 30% premium for the ring to be made.  To find the premium, multiply the total cost by 30%: 30% x 900 = 270.  Add this to the original cost to find the total amount James paid: 900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
 James had to pay 30% premium on the total cost of the ring.  He had to pay for the diamond, which was $600, and the gold, which was $300.  So the total cost of the ring is 600 + 300 = 900.  Then, he had to pay 30% of that, which is (0. 30) x 900 = 270 dollars.  So he paid in total 900 + 270 = 1170 dollars.  The answer is 1170. 
 James starts with the cost of the ring, which is the diamond ($600) and the gold ($300), making it 600 + 300 = 900.  Then he pays a 30% premium.  To find the premium, I need to add 30% to 900.  To find 30% of 900, I will multiply 900 by the decimal equivalent of 30%, which is 0. 3.  So 900 * 0. 3 = 270.  Adding the premium to the cost, I get 900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170.

[EXP] 117: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 79, [output]:  Rose started with 3 flowers, each with 5 petals, so she had 3 x 5 = 15 petals.  Then she picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each, so 4 x 6 = 24 petals.  Then she picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each, so 5 x 4 = 20 petals.  Finally, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each, so 6 x 7 = 42 petals.  In total, she had 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.  However, she dropped 1 of each type of flower, so she lost 1 x 5 = 5 petals from the 5-petal flowers, 1 x 6 = 6 petals from the 6-petal flowers, 1 x 4 = 4 petals from the 4-petal flowers, and 1 x 7 = 7 petals from the 7-petal flowers.  So she lost a total of 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals.  So she has 101 - 22 = 79 petals left.  The answer is 79. 
3 flowers with 5 petals each is 3 x 5 = 15 petals.  4 flowers with 6 petals each is 4 x 6 = 24 petals.  5 flowers with 4 petals each is 5 x 4 = 20 petals.  6 flowers with 7 petals each is 6 x 7 = 42 petals.  15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101.  Since she loses one of each type of flower, that's 1 * 5 + 1 * 6 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 7 = 22 petals.  So the total remaining petals in the vase is 101 - 22 = 79 petals.  The answer is 79. 
 Rose starts with 3 flowers with 5 petals each.  So that's 3 * 5 = 15 petals.  She picks 4 more flowers with 6 petals each.  So that's 4 * 6 = 24 petals.  Then she picks 5 more flowers with 4 petals each.  So that's 5 * 4 = 20 petals.  Lastly, she picks 6 more flowers with 7 petals each.  So that's 6 * 7 = 42 petals.  
After dropping 1 of each type of flower, she has 2 flowers with 5 petals each, 3 flowers with 6 petals each, 4 flowers with 4 petals each, and 5 flowers with 7 petals each.  
The total petals in the vase are (2 * 5) + (3 * 6) + (4 * 4) + (5 * 7).  That is 10 + 18 + 16 + 35 = 79 petals. 
The answer is 79. 
1.  Rose starts by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each.  3 x 5 = 15 petals.  Then she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  4 x 6 = 24 petals.  Next she adds 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  5 x 4 = 20 petals.  Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each.  6 x 7 = 42 petals.  In total, the flowers have 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 petals.  That is 101 petals. 

Rose then drops 1 of each type of flower.  So she loses 1*5 = 5 petals from the flowers with 5 petals
1*6 = 6 petals from the flowers with 6 petals
1*4 = 4 petals from the flowers with 4 petals
1*7 = 7 petals from the flowers with 7 petals.  In total, Rose loses 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals. 

So, after dropping the petals, she is left with 101 - 22 petals in the vase.  101 - 22 is 79.  The answer is 79. 
 We can start with the first type of flowers that Rose picked, which were 3 flowers with 5 petals each.  The total number of petals for these flowers is 3 x 5 = 15. 

Next, she picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  The total number of petals for these flowers is 4 x 6 = 24. 

Rose then picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  The total number of petals for these flowers is 5 x 4 = 20. 

After that, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each.  The total number of petals for these flowers is 6 x 7 = 42. 

So the total number of petals for all the flowers is 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101. 

However, the problem states that Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, so she lost a total of 1 x 5 = 5 petals from the first type, 1 x 6 = 6 petals from the second type, 1 x 4 = 4 petals from the third type, and 1 x 7 = 7 petals from the fourth type.  The total number of petals she lost is 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22. 

To find the total number of petals she has left, we subtract the number of petals she lost from the total number of petals she started with: 101 - 22 = 79. 

So the answer is 79.

5 green eggs.  She has twice as many blue eggs as green, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.  She has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so that's 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so that's 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.  Total number of eggs is 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27.  The answer is 27. 
 Let's start by identifying the number of green eggs Cindy had: 5 green eggs. 

She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 x 5 = 10 blue eggs. 

She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. 

She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 ÷ 3 = 3 yellow eggs. 

Now, let's count the total number of eggs Cindy has: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27 eggs. 

The answer is 27. 
 Let's start with the green eggs, which is 5.  Since there are twice as many blue eggs, the number of blue eggs is 5 x 2 = 10.  There is one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so there are 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  Finally, there is one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs.  So, the number of yellow eggs is 9 / 3 = 3. 

In total, Cindy has 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.  The answer is 27. 
5 green eggs.  2 times as many blue eggs as green eggs is 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs.  1 fewer pink egg than blue eggs is 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  One-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs is 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.  Adding all the types of eggs up gets us 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27.  The answer is 27. 
 Let's start by identifying the number of blue eggs Cindy had.  Since she has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, and she has 5 green eggs, the number of blue eggs is 2 x 5 = 10. 

Next, let's find the number of pink eggs.  Since she has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, the number of pink eggs is 10 - 1 = 9. 

Now, let's find the number of yellow eggs.  Since she has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, the number of yellow eggs is 9 ÷ 3 = 3. 

Finally, let's add up the number of eggs Cindy has:
   - 5 green eggs
   - 10 blue eggs
   - 9 pink eggs
   - 3 yellow eggs

That's a total of 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.  The answer is 27. 
 Let's start by using the information that she had 5 green eggs.  Since she has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she has 2 x 5 = 10 blue eggs. 
To find the number of pink eggs, we know that she has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. 
Finally, we know that she has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, which means she has 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

To convert inches to feet, divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot).  

480/12 = 40 feet 

The answer is 40 feet. 
 If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times that, which is 12 inches.  If Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times that, which is 4 x 12 = 48 inches.  And Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times that, which is 10 x 48 = 480 inches.  To convert to feet, we multiply by 12 because there are 12 inches in a foot.

We know that there are 12 inches in a foot, so we have to convert the inches to feet.  There are 480 / 12 = 40 feet. 

The answer is 40. 
 Let's start with what Sarky can lift, which is 12 times higher than Pompei, who can lift 1 inch.  So Saskay can lift 12 inches. 

Then, Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, who can lift 12 inches.  So Kagiyami can lift 12 * 4 = 48 inches. 

Finally, Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, who can lift 48 inches.  So Naruto can lift 48 * 10 = 480 inches. 

To convert inches to feet, divide 480 inches by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot).  480 / 12 = 40.  The answer is 40. 
 Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.  Saskay can lift 12 times that, so Sarkay can lift a mountain 12 inches.  Kagiyami can lift 4 times as high as Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 12 x 4 = 48 inches.  Naruto can lift 10 times as high as Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 48 x 10 = 480 inches.  

1 inch = 1/12 foot (since there are 12 inches per 1 foot)
So 480 inches = 480 / 12 = 40 feet
The answer is 40.

[EXP] 121: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]: 1/6 of 12 millimeters is 12 * 1/6 = 2 millimeters.  2/3 of 12 millimeters is 12 * 2/3 = 8 millimeters.  1/2 of 12 millimeters is 12 * 1/2 = 6 millimeters.  So there are 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters left.  The answer is 16. 
12 * 1/6 = 2 millimeters, 12 * 2/3 = 8 millimeters, 12 * 1/2 = 6 millimeters.  So the total length of glue sticks that are not used is 2 + 8 + 6.  2 + 8 + 6 is 16.  The answer is 16. 
1/6 of the first glue stick, 2/3 of the second, and 1/2 of the third glue stick are not used.  So, 1/6 of 12mm = 2mm, 2/3 of 12mm = 8mm, and 1/2 of 12mm = 6mm are not used.  In total, 2 + 8 + 6 = 16mm are not used.  The answer is 16. 
 Let's start by identifying how much of each glue stick is not used:

* The first glue stick has 1/6 of the original length remaining, which is 12 * (1/6) = 2 millimeters. 
* The second glue stick has 2/3 of the original length remaining, which is 12 * (2/3) = 8 millimeters. 
* The third glue stick has 1/2 of the original length remaining, which is 12 * (1/2) = 6 millimeters. 

To find the total length of glue sticks that are not used, we add up the remaining lengths: 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters. 

The answer is 16. 
1/6 can be converted to a decimal by dividing by 6, which gives us 0. 1667.  This means that one glue stick has 0. 1667 x 12 = 2 millimeters left.  The second glue stick has 2/3 = 0. 6667 and 0. 6667 x 12 = 8 millimeters left.  The third glue stick has 1/2 = 0. 5 and 0. 5 x 12 = 6 millimeters left.  So the total length of glue sticks that are not used is 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters.  The answer is 16. 
3 glue sticks originally 12 mm each. 

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which is 1/6 * 12 = 2 mm left. 

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which is 2/3 * 12 = 8 mm left. 

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which is 1/2 * 12 = 6 mm left. 

The total length of glue sticks that are not used is 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 mm. 

So, Patrick has 16 mm left. 

The answer is 16. 
 Let's first find the length of the used glue stick for each stick. 

First stick: 1/6 of the glue stick is left, which means 5/6 is used.  5/6 of 12 is 10.  So, the first glue stick used 10 mm. 

Second stick: 2/3 of the glue stick is left, which means 1/3 is used.  1/3 of 12 is 4.  So, the second glue stick used 4 mm. 

Third stick: 1/2 of the glue stick is left, which means 1/2 is used.  1/2 of 12 is 6.  So, the third glue stick used 6 mm. 

The total length of the glue sticks used is the sum of the lengths of the used parts of each glue stick:
10 + 4 + 6 = 20

The total length of the glue sticks not used is the sum of the lengths of the remaining parts of each glue stick:
1/6 + 2/3 + 1/2 of 12
= 2 + 8 + 6

[EXP] 122: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 975, [output]: 300 is the original amount.  300 * 0. 75 = 225 is the interest in one year.  In 3 years, the total interest will be 3 * 225 = 675.  Adding this to the original amount, Brenda will have 300 + 675 = 975 dollars.  The answer is 975. 
300 * 3/4 = 225.  3 years of 225 dollars is 3 * 225 = 675.  Brenda originally had 300 dollars, so the final amount is 300 + 675 = 975.  The answer is 975. 
300 dollars were initially added to the scheme.  The simple interest earned each year is $\frac{3}{4}$ of the original amount, which is $\frac{3}{4} \* 300 = 225$.  For 3 years, this will be a total interest of 3 * 225 = 675.  300 + 675 is 975.  The answer is 975. 
300 dollars is the original amount.  Simple interest is calculated at a rate of 3/4 of the original amount per year, so per year, Brenda earns 300 * 3/4 = 225 dollars.  
After one year, Brenda will have the original amount 300, plus the interest 225, so she has 300 + 225 = 525. 
The same process applies for the next two years.

The answer is 975. 
300 dollars were originally invested.  Simple interest will be earned.  The rate is 3/4 of the original amount.  So at the end of the first year, 300 * 3/4 = 225 will be accumulated in interest.  So, 300 + 225 is 525 dollars.  At the end of the second year, another 225 (3/4 * 525 = 225) will be added to make it 750.  At the end of the third year, another 225 (3/4 * 750 = 225) will be added to make it 975.  The answer is 975. 
 Brenda invested $300 originally.  Simple interest is a percentage of the original amount.  The rate of simple interest is 3/4 times the original amount, which is 0. 75 times 300, or 225.

 Let's break this down step by step. 

In the first year, they will build 12 homes. 

In the second year, they will build three times this many homes, which is 12 x 3 = 36 homes. 

In the third year, they will count how many homes they have built and double the amount.  In the first two years, they built 12 + 36 = 48 homes.  Doubling this amount is 48 x 2 = 96 homes. 

To find the total number of homes built over three years, add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.  The answer is 144. 
1st year, the town builds 12 homes.  2nd year, they build 12 x 3 = 36 homes.  3rd year, they double the total homes they have built, which is 12 + 36 = 48.  48 x 2 = 96.  The total number of homes they will build in 3 years is 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.  The answer is 144. 
 The town will build 12 homes in the first year.  In the second year, they will build 12 x 3 = 36 homes.  So, after the first two years, they will have 12 + 36 = 48 homes.  In the third year, they will double the amount, so they will double 48 to have 96 homes.  The total number of homes they will have built over the next three years is 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.  The answer is 144. 
12 homes were built in the first year.  In the next year, three times this amount will be built, which is 3 x 12 = 36.  In the third year, the number of homes is doubled, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96.  Then add the number of homes in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.  The answer is 144. 
12 homes were built in the first year.  In the next year, 3 times as many homes were built.  12 x 3 = 36.  So 36 homes were built in the second year.  In the third year, the town will double the total homes built so far.  12 + 36 = 48 homes were built in the first two years.  Doubling this amount gives 2 x 48 = 96.  In total, the town will have built 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes over the next three years.  The answer is 144. 
12 homes will be built in the first year.  In the next year, they will build 3 * 12 = 36 homes.  In the last year, they will add double the amount of the previous years (12 + 36).  So in total, they will build 12 + 36 + 2 * (12 + 36) = 12 + 36 + 2 * 48 = 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.  The answer is 144. 
 The town starts by building 12 homes in the first year.  In the next year, they build 3 times this many, which is 3 x 12 = 36 homes.  So, the total number of homes they have built after the second year is 12 + 36 = 48.  In the third year, they double this number, which will be 2 x 48 = 96 homes.  The town will have built 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes over the next three years.  The answer is 144.

First, in the first year, they will build 12 homes. 

Second, in the next year, they will build 3 times as many, which is 3 x 12 = 36 homes. 

Third, in the third year, they will double the amount they have built so far, which is 12 + 36 = 48.  Doubling 48 is 2 x 48 = 96. 

To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we add these up: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.  The answer is 144. 
 In the first year, they will build 12 homes.  In the next year, they will build three times this many homes.  Three times 12 is 12 x 3 = 36.  So in the second year, they will build 36 homes.  In the third year, they will double the amount they built in the first two years.  They built 12 homes in the first year, and 36 in the second year.  So all together, they built 12 + 36 = 48 homes.

 The town will build 12 homes in the first year.  Then they will build 3 times as many in the second year.  3 x 12 = 36.  So in the second year, the town will build 36 homes.  In the third year, they will add double the amount of homes built in the first two years.  The first two years, they built 12 + 36 = 48 homes.  Double that is 48 x 2 = 96.  Adding the third year's total, the town will build 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.  The answer is 144. 
 The town will build 12 homes in the first year.  In the next year, they will build three times this many homes, which would be 12 x 3 = 36.  After 2 years, they will have built 12 + 36 = 48 homes.  In the third year, they will build twice the amount they have built so far.  To double the amount, we multiply 48 x 2 = 96.  So in total, the town will build 12 + 36 + 96 homes over the three years.  12 + 36 + 96 = 144.  The answer is 144. 
12 homes will be built in the first year.  The next year, they will build 3 times as many homes as in the first year.  So that is 3 x 12 = 36.  For the final year, they will double the number of homes they have built.  So they have 12 + 36 = 48 homes so far.  Double 48 is 96.  12 + 36 + 96 is 144.  The answer is 144. 
 In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.  In the second year, they will build 3 times this many, so that's 12 x 3 = 36.

30 kids want 4 jello cups each.  So 4 x 30 = 120 jello cups are needed.  Originally, a box makes 10 jello cups.  So 120/10 = 12 boxes of jello are needed.  Since each box costs $1. 25, 12 boxes will cost 12 x 1. 25 = 15 dollars.  The answer is 15. 
 First, let's figure out how many jello cups Greg needs.  4 cups per kid and 30 kids is 4 x 30 = 120 cups.  If each box makes 10 cups, then Greg will need 120 / 10 = 12 boxes of jello.  Each box costs $1. 25.  12 boxes will cost 12 x 1. 25 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
4 jello cups per kid and there are 30 kids.  That is 4 x 30 = 120 jello cups.  Each box makes 10 jello cups.  So to make 120 jello cups, we need 120 / 10 = 12 boxes of jello.  Each box costs $1. 25.  12 boxes will be 12 x 1. 25 = 15 dollars.  The answer is 15. 
30 kids need 4 jello cups each, so in total Greg needs 30 x 4 = 120 jello cups.  Since each box makes 10 jello cups, he will need 120 / 10 = 12 boxes.  He will need 12 boxes of jello.  If each box costs 1. 25 dollars, he will spend 12 x 1. 25 = 15 dollars on jello.  The answer is 15. 
30 kids will have 4 jello cups each, so the total amount of jello cups needed is 4 * 30 = 120.  Each jello mix box makes 10 cups, so Greg needs 120 / 10 = 12 boxes.  The cost of each box is $1. 25, so the total cost will be 12 * 1. 25 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
30 kids and each gets 4 jello cups, so Greg needs 4 x 30 = 120 jello cups.  A 3-ounce box of jello makes 10 jello cups, so he would need 120 / 10 = 12 boxes of jello.  Since each 3-ounce box costs $1. 25, Greg would spend 12 * 1. 25 = 15 dollars.  The answer is 15. 
 First, we need to calculate how many small jello cups Greg will need.  Each child will have 4 jello cups, and there will be 30 kids.  So he needs 30 x 4 = 120 jello cups. 

Since one 3-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups, Greg will need 120/10 = 12 boxes of jello. 

Each box costs 1. 25 dollars, so he will spend 12 x 1. 25 = 15 dollars on jello. 

The answer is 15. 
30 kids and each kid needs 4 jello cups means 30 * 4 = 120 cups of jello in total are needed.  A three-ounce box makes 10 cups.  So Greg will need 120 / 10 = 12 boxes of flavored jello.  Since each box costs $1. 25, Greg will have to spend 12 * 1. 25 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
 Each box of jello makes 10 small jello cups.  For each kid to have 4 cups, we need to make 30 x 4 = 120 cups.  With 3-ounce boxes of jello, we need 120 / 10 = 12 boxes of jello.  Each box costs 1. 25 dollars.  So 12 boxes will cost 12 * 1. 25 = 15 dollars.  The answer is 15. 
 To find out how many jello cups Greg needs for the party, he needs 30 kids * 4 jello cups per kid = 120 jello cups.  Since one box of jello makes 10 jello cups, he needs 120 ÷ 10 = 12 boxes of jello.  Each box costs $1. 25, so to find the total cost, he needs to multiply 12 boxes * $1. 25 per box = $15.  The answer is 15. 
4 jello cups per kid and 30 kids means that in total, Greg will need 4 x 30 = 120 jello cups.  To find how many boxes of jello he will need, we divide 120 by the number of jello cups each box contains: 120 / 10 = 12 boxes.  The cost of 12 boxes at $1. 25 per box will be 12 x 1. 25 = 15 dollars.  The answer is 15. 
4 small jello cups per kid means that 30 kids require 4 x 30 = 120 jello cups.  
Since 1 box of jello makes 10 small jello cups, Greg will need 120 / 10 = 12 boxes.  
The cost of 1 box is given as $1. 25, so 12 boxes will cost 12 x 1. 25 = 15 dollars.  The answer is 15. 
3-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups.  If each kid will have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups needed is 30 x 4 = 120 jello cups. 

Since each 3-ounce box makes 10 jello cups, we need to find out how many 3-ounce boxes are needed to make 120 jello cups.  To do this, we divide 120 by 10:

120 ÷ 10 = 12

So, we need 12 boxes of flavored jello. 

Since each box costs $1. 25, the total cost of jello for the party is:

12 x $1. 25 = $15

The answer is 15. 
1st step, find out how many jello cups Greg needs.  Each kid needs 4 cups.  There will be 30 kids.  So Greg needs 30 * 4 = 120 jello cups.

3rd step, calculate the cost.  Each box costs 1. 25 dollars.  He needs 12 boxes.  12 boxes * 1. 25 dollars per box = 15 dollars. 
The answer is 15. 
30 kids need 30 x 4 = 120 small jello cups.  Each jello cup is 3 ounces x (1/10) = 0. 3 ounces.  0. 3 ounces x 120 = 36 ounces.  So Greg needs 36 ounces of jello.  Since a box of jello is 3 ounces, Greg will need to buy 36 / 3 = 12 boxes of jello.  Each box is $1. 25, so Greg will spend 12 x 1. 25 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
 First, we need to find out how many cups of jello Greg will need.  He wants each kid to have 4 cups, and there will be 30 kids.  So, 30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups of jello.  Each box of flavored jello makes 10 cups, so Greg will need integer division of 120 by 10 to find out how many boxes of jello he will need.  120 / 10 = 12.

In total, Kelly has spent 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 dollars.  She has 65 dollars total, so after spending 60 dollars, she has 65 - 60 dollars left.  65 - 60 is 5.  The answer is 5. 
 A to-do list for this problem:
- Total cost of bacon: 10 dollars
- Total cost of chicken: 6 packets.  Chicken cost twice as much as bacon.  Bacon costs 10 / 5 = 2 dollars per pack.  Chicken costs 4 dollars per pack.  So 6 packets of chicken cost 6 x 4 = 24 dollars
- Total cost of strawberries: 3 packets at 4 dollars each, so 3 x 4 = 12 dollars
- Total cost of apples: 7 packets at 2 dollars each, so 7 x 2 = 14 dollars
- Total cost so far: 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60
- Kelly's budget: 65 dollars. 
- Kelly has spent 60 dollars so far.  She has 65 - 60 = 5 dollars left.  The answer is 5. 
1.  Kelly spent 10 dollars on 5 packs of bacon. 

2.  A packet of bacon costs 10 / 5 = 2 dollars.  
    Kelly also has 6 packets of chicken.  Each costs 2 * 2 = 4 dollars, 
    so the total cost of the chicken packets is 6 * 4 = 24 dollars. 
    The total cost of bacon and chicken is 10 + 24 = 34. 

3.  Kelly also spent 4 dollars on each of the 3 packs of strawberries, 
    so the total cost is 3 * 4 = 12 dollars. 
    Kelly also spent half the price, which is 4 / 2 = 2 dollars, 
    on each of the 7 packs of apples.  
    The total cost of the apples is 7 * 2 = 14 dollars. 

4.  Kelly has spent a total of 34 + 12 + 14 = 60 dollars so far.  
    She has 65 dollars in her budget, so she has 65 - 60 = 5 dollars left. 
    The answer is 5. 
 Kelly is grocery shopping. 
Kelly buys:
5 packs of bacon that cost $10. 
6 packets of chicken each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon.  So each packet of chicken costs 2 * 2 = $4.  6 packets of chicken will be 6 * 4 = $24. 
3 packs of strawberries, each costing $4 each.  So 3 packs of strawberries will be 3 * 4 = $12. 
7 packs of apples each cost half the price of a pack of strawberries.  So it costs (4 / 2) = 2 dollars per pack of apples.  7 packs of apples will be 7 * 2 = 14 dollars. 

In total, she will be spending 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 dollars.  That's 60 dollars. 
Her budget is 65 dollars, so she has 65 - 60 = 5 dollars left in her budget. 
The answer is 5. 
1.  First, we calculate the cost of the packets of bacon and chicken.  5 packs of bacon is $10 total, which means each pack of bacon costs 10 / 5 = 2 dollars.  Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so it costs 2 * 2 = 4 dollars.  6 packets of chicken will be 6 * 4 = 24 dollars.  The total cost of the bacon and chicken is 10 + 24 = 34 dollars.  2.  Next, we calculate the cost of the strawberries and apples.  The 3 packs of strawberries will be 3 * 4 = 12 dollars.  The 7 packs of apples each cost half of a strawberry pack, so each costs 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.  7 packs of apples will be 7 * 2 = 14 dollars.  The total cost of the strawberries and apples is 12 + 14 = 26 dollars.  3.  We now have the total cost of all the items, which is 34 + 26 = 60 dollars.  To find the amount of money left in Kelly’s budget, we subtract this total cost from her budget.  65 - 60 = 5.  The answer is 5 dollars.

In total, 10 + 6 = 16 yards of material is needed.  The answer is 16. 
4 small masks require 2 yards of material.  So 20 small masks will require 20/4 x 2 = 10 yards of material.  8 large masks require 8/3 x 2. 25 = 6 yards of material.  To make 20 small and 8 large masks, Jo will need 10 + 6 yards of material.  10 + 6 = 16 yards of material.  The answer is 16. 
 Jo makes 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.  So for one small mask, she needs 2/4 yard of material.  To make 20 small masks, she needs 20 x 2/4 = 10 yards of material.  She makes 3 large masks with 2. 25 yards of material.  So for one large mask, she needs 2. 25/3 = 0. 75 yard of material.  To make 8 large masks, she needs 8 x 0. 75 = 6 yards of material.  In total, she needs 10 + 6 = 16 yards of material.  The answer is 16. 
20 small masks and 8 large masks.  
4 small masks require 2 yards of material.  So 20 small masks will require 20 / 4 * 2 = 10 yards.  
3 large masks require 2. 25 yards of material.  So 8 large masks will require 8 / 3 * 2. 25 = 6 yards.  
10 yards + 6 yards = 16.  The answer is 16. 
2 yards of material are needed for 4 small masks, so 1 small mask takes 2/4 yards = 0. 5 yards.  0. 5 x 20 = 10 yards are needed for 20 small masks. 

2. 25 yards are needed for 3 large masks, so 1 large mask takes 2. 25/3 yards = 0. 75 yards.  0. 75 x 8 = 6 yards are needed for 8 large masks. 

So, in total, 10 + 6 = 16 yards of material are needed.  The answer is 16. 
2 yards can make 4 small masks.  So to make 20 small masks, we need 20 divided by 4, which is 5, times 2 yards, which is 10 yards.  For the 8 large masks, we need 8 divided by 3, which is 2. 67, times 2. 25, which is about 6 yards.  In total we need 10 + 6 = 16 yards.  The answer is 16. 
 Let's break it down into small masks and large masks. 

For small masks, 4 masks require 2 yards of material, so 1 small mask requires 2/4 yards of material, which is 1/2 a yard.  To make 20 small masks, Jo will need 20 * (1/2) yards of material, which is 10 yards. 

For large masks, 3 masks require 2. 25 yards of material, so 1 large mask requires 2. 25/3 yards of material, which is 0. 75 yards.  To make 8 large masks, Jo will need 8 * 0. 75 yards of material, which is 6 yards. 

In total, Jo needs 10 yards of material for small masks and 6 yards of material for large masks.  So, she will need 10 + 6 = 16 yards of material.  The answer is 16. 
 We want to find the total yards of material Jo would need.  For the small masks, she needs 2 yards of material for 4 masks.  To find the total yards for the small masks, we multiply the number of masks by the yards per masks: 20 small masks * 2 yards/4 masks = 10 yards.  For the large masks, she needs 2. 25 yards of material for 3 masks.  To find the total yards for the large masks, we multiply the number of masks by the yards per mask: 8 large masks * 2. 25 yards/3 masks = 6 yards.  Now we add the total yards needed for both the small and large masks: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.  The answer is 16. 
2 yards of material is needed to make 4 small masks.  We can determine the amount of material needed for a single small mask by dividing 2 yards by 4 masks: 2 yards / 4 masks = 0. 5 yards per small mask.  Therefore, to make 20 small masks, we need 0. 5 yards per small mask * 20 small masks = 10 yards. 

3 large masks need 2. 25 yards of material.  We can determine the amount of material needed for a single large mask by dividing 2. 25 yards by 3 masks: 2. 25 yards / 3 masks = 0. 75 yards per large mask.  Therefore, to make 8 large masks, we need 0. 75 yards per large mask * 8 large masks = 6 yards. 

To make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we need 10 yards for small masks and 6 yards for large masks.  In total, 10 + 6 = 16 yards of material are needed.  The answer is 16 yards. 
 To find out how many yards of material Jo will need, we need to calculate the total material needed for the small masks and the total material needed for the large masks.  

Since Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material, we can find the material needed for one small mask.  2 yards / 4 small masks = 0. 5 yards per small mask.  

Since we want 20 small masks, we will need 20 * 0. 5 yards = 10 yards for the small masks.  

For the large masks, we can find the material needed for one large mask.  2. 25 yards / 3 large masks = 0. 75 yards per large mask.  

Since we want 8 large masks, we will need 8 * 0. 75 yards = 6 yards for the large masks.  

The total material needed will be the sum of the material needed for the small masks and the large masks.  10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.  

The answer is 16. 
 Jo works with 2 yards of material for 4 small masks.  So 2 yards of material will give her 4 small masks.  4 small masks times x number of small masks, that's 4x yards to make x number of small masks.  So for 20 small masks, she'll need 20/4 * 2 = 10 yards of material.  

Now for the large masks, Jo works with 2. 25 yards of material for 3 large masks.  So 2. 25 yards of material will give her 3 large masks.  3 large masks times x number of large masks, that's 3x yards to make x number of large masks.  So for 8 large masks, she'll need 8/3 * 2. 25 = 6 yards of material.  

To make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, Jo will need 10 + 6 = 16 yards of material.  The answer is 16.

In total, Farmer Brown's farm and Farmer Smith's farm have 200 + 500 = 700 acres.  The answer is 700. 
 Let's break this down step by step!

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 
Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that. 

To find out twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm, we multiply 200 acres by 2:

200 acres x 2 = 400 acres

Then, we add 100 acres to that:

400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres

Now, we have the size of Farmer Smith's farm, which is 500 acres. 

To find the total number of acres of both farms together, we add the sizes of both farms:

200 acres (Brown's farm) + 500 acres (Smith's farm) = 700 acres

The answer is 700 acres. 
 First, let's find the number of acres Farmer Smith's farm has.  It is 100 acres more than twice the number of acres Farmer Brown's farm has.  Farmer Brown's farm has 200 acres.  Twice that is 400 acres.  So 100 more acres than that would be 400 + 100 = 500 acres. 

Now we have to find the total number of acres for both farms.  Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.  Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.  The total is 200 + 500 = 700 acres.  The answer is 700. 
 The farm Brown has 200 acres.  Twice that amount is 200 + 200 = 400.  Then adding the difference of 100, we get 400 + 100 = 500.  Farmer Smith has 500 acres.  The total is the sum of the two: 200 + 500 = 700.  The answer is 700. 
eacher Brown's farm is 200 acres.  Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that.  So it's 2 * 200 + 100 acres, or 400 + 100 acres.  That is a total of 500 acres.  Then, 200 + 500 acres is 700 acres.  The answer is 700. 
 Let's start by finding the number of acres Farmer Smith's farm has.  We know it's 100 more than twice Farmer Brown's farm, which has 200 acres.  So, we can calculate it as:

Twice Farmer Brown's farm = 2 * 200 = 400
Farmer Smith's farm = 400 + 100 = 500

Now, to find the total number of acres the two farms have, we add the number of acres each farm has:

Farmer Brown's farm = 200
Farmer Smith's farm = 500

Total acres together = 200 + 500 = 700

The answer is 700. 
 First, we find the acres on Farmer Smith's farm.  Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm.  Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, so twice that would be 200 x 2 = 400.  The 100 more would make it 400 + 100 = 500.  So the total acres on Farmer Smith's farm is 500.  Then, we find the total acres between the two farms.  Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.  Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.  200 + 500 = 700.  The answer is 700.

[EXP] 133: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 4 hours for one trip means that 8 hours is 2 trips.  The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.  So in each trip, he needs to collect 24 / 2 = 12 berries.  The answer is 12. 
 The sloth has 8 hours to collect berries.  Each trip takes 4 hours.  So he can make 8/4 = 2 trips.  The sloth can make 2 trips.  If he picks the same number of berries each trip, then he can pick 24/2 = 12 berries per trip.  The answer is 12. 
 The sloth takes a trip down the tree every 4 hours.  So in 8 hours, the sloth will take 8 / 4 = 2 trips.  If he wants to collect 24 berries, he needs 24 berries divided by the number of trips he takes.  24 / 2 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
24 berries need to be picked in 8 hours.  Each trip takes 4 hours.  So there will be 8 / 4 = 2 trips.  2 trips means 2 batches of berries.  To find out how many berries he can pick in one batch, divide 24 by 2.  24 / 2 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
24 berries are needed in 8 hours.  8 hours is 8 trips.  Each trip takes 4 hours, so the sloth can make 8/4 = 2 trips per day.  Since he needs to collect 24 berries, 24/2 = 12 berries can be picked each trip.  The answer is 12. 
24 berries are collected in 8 hours.  Each trip including both going up and down the tree takes 4 hours.  So he collects berries in 8 / 4 = 2 trips.  If he collects the same number of berries each trip, then he collects 24 / 2 = 12 berries per trip.  The answer is 12. 
 Let's find out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.  Since the sloth eats one meal per trip, if it takes 4 hours per trip, the sloth can only make 8/4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.  Since the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, the number of berries in one trip must be 24/2 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
 The sloth can eat in 8 hours, but for every 4 hours, he goes to the tree once.  So, he goes to the tree 2 times in 8 hours.   He needs to collect 24 berries, so let's divide 24 by 2.  24 / 2 = 12.   The answer is 12. 
 The sloth makes one trip for every 4 hours.  For 8 hours, he makes 8 / 4 = 2 trips.  In each trip, he can get the same number of berries.  So he picked x berries on each trip.  Then 2 x = 24.  To find x, we divide both sides by 2.  We get x = 12.  The answer is 12. 
4 hours are used per trip to get berries, and he wants to get a total of 24 berries in 8 hours.  So, he has 8 - 4 = 4 hours free to pick berries.  He wants to divide the 4 hours into equal intervals.  So, in each of the two intervals, he can pick up 24 / 2 = 12 berries.  The answer is 12. 
 The sloth starts with zero berries.   Let's figure out how many times he goes down in 8 hours.   For each trip down, it takes 4 hours.   8 hours can be broken down into 2 trips.  2 trips is 4 hours.   So, 8 hours can have at most 2 trips.   If he can pick up x berries per trip, then in 2 trips he will pick up 2x berries.   Since we need 24 berries, we set up the equation 2x = 24.  2x = 24 can be simplified to x = 12.   So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.  The answer is 12. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

The sloth eats only when he is up in his tree.  He makes the trip down, picks up berries, and climbs back up.  Let's find how many trips he makes in 8 hours. 

First, find the total number of hours he spends on the trips to collect berries.  This is 4 hours per trip.  To find the number of trips, divide the total time by the time per trip: 8 hours ÷ 4 hours per trip = 2 trips. 

The sloth makes 2 trips.  Let's find what happens on each trip.  The question asks that the sloth collects 24 berries, and he makes 2 trips.  This means each trip he picks up 24 ÷ 2 = 12 berries. 

The answer is 12. 
 Let's break this down step by step. 

The sloth can collect berries for 8 hours (since that's the total time given).  He makes trip down and up the tree for each set of berries.  So, let's find out how many trips he can make in that time. 

He can make a trip every 4 hours, since that's how long it takes him to make the trip.  Since 8 hours can be divided by 4, he can make 2 trips. 

For 2 trips, he needs to find the minimum number of berries he can collect per trip to reach 24 berries in total.  Let's think about it like a math problem!

He has 24 berries to collect, and he can collect them in 2 trips.  For each trip, he needs to collect 24 / 2 = 12 berries. 

The answer is 12. 
 Let's break down the sloth's trip.  It takes him 4 hours to go down, pick up berries, and climb back up.  We want to know how many berries he can collect each trip since he picks the same number each time.  

We know he has 8 hours to collect 24 berries.  In 8 hours, the sloth can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips.  

In each trip, the sloth picks up x berries, where x is our unknown.  Since he makes 2 trips, he picks up a total of 2x berries.  

We know his total berries picked is 24, so we can set up the equation 2x = 24.  

To find the value of x, we will divide both sides by 2.  2x / 2 = 24 / 2.  

So, x = 12.  The sloth can collect 12 berries each trip if he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. 

The answer is 12.

[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Let John's age be x. 
Then, Paul's age is x + 10, as Paul is 10 years older than John. 

We are given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's and John's age, so:
Peter's age = Paul's age + John's age
Peter's age = (x + 10) + x
Peter's age = 2x + 10

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
x + (x + 10) + (2x + 10) = 100
Combine like terms:
4x + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4x = 80
Divide by 4:
x = 20

So, John's age is 20 years old. 
Paul's age is 20 + 10 = 30 years old. 
Peter's age is 2x + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 years old. 
The answer is 50. 
 Let's break it down step by step!

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. 

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than John, so the age of John can be represented as x, and the age of Paul can be represented as x + 10. 

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, which means Peter's age can be represented as (x + 10) + x = 2x + 10. 

Now we can set up an equation using the information given:

2x + 10 + x + x + 10 = 100

Combine like terms:

4x + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4x = 80

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 20

Now that we know John's age is 20, we can find Peter's age:

Peter's age = (x + 10) + x = 20 + 10 + 20 = 50

So Peter is 50 years old. 

The answer is 50. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 

We know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so let's call Paul's age "x" and John's age "x - 10" (since Paul is 10 years older than John). 

The equation for Peter's age would be: Peter's age = Paul's age + John's age
= x + (x - 10)
= 2x - 10

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, so we can set up an equation:
Peter's age + Paul's age + John's age = 100
2x - 10 + x + (x - 10) = 100

Combine like terms:
4x - 20 = 100

Add 20 to both sides:
4x = 120

Divide by 4:
x = 30

So Paul's age is 30.  Since Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age, and Paul's age is 30, John's age is 30 - 10 = 20. 

Now we can find Peter's age:
Peter's age = Paul's age + John's age = 30 + 20 = 50

The answer is 50. 
 Let's start by finding the age of Paul and John.  Since Paul is 10 years older than John, let's call John's age "x".  Then Paul's age is x + 10.  

The problem states that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.  So Peter's age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10. 

The problem also states that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old.  We can set up an equation using the ages:

Peter + Paul + John = 100

Substituting the expressions we found earlier, we get:

2x + 10 + x + x + 10 = 100

Combine like terms:

4x + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4x = 80

Divide by 4:

x = 20

So John's age is 20, and Paul's age is x + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30. 

Finally, we can find Peter's age, which is the sum of Paul and John's age:

Peter's age = 20 + 30 = 50

The answer is 50. 
 Let's call Jean's age as X.  Then Paul's age will be X + 10 since Paul is 10 years older than Jean.  According to the problem, Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages, so Peter's age can be written as X + 10 + X = 2X + 10. 

Now we can write an equation to represent the combined age of the three people:

X + (X + 10) + (2X + 10) = 100

Combine like terms:
4X + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4X = 80

Divide both sides by 4:
X = 20

Now, we know Jean's age is 20.  Paul's age is Jean's age + 10, so Paul's age is 20 + 10 = 30.  Peter's age is the sum of Paul and Jean's ages, so Peter's age is 20 + 30 = 50. 

The answer is 50. 
 To solve this problem, let's represent the age of Peter, Paul, and Jean with variables: P for Peter, P-10 for Paul (since Paul is 10 years older than John), and J for John.  Since Jean's age is not explicitly mentioned, we can represent it as J. 

We are given the following information:

1.  The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old.  We can write this as:

P + (P-10) + J = 100
2.  Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.  We can write this as:

P = P-10 + J

Now we have a system of equations.  We can solve the second equation for P:

P = P-10 + J
P - (P-10) = J
P - P + 10 = J
10 = J

So, John's age is 10. 

Now we substitute J = 10 back into the first equation:

P + (P-10) + 10 = 100
P + P - 10 + 10 = 100
2P = 100
P = 50

So, Peter's age is 50. 

The answer is 50. 
 Let's break down the information given: 

Paul is 10 years older than John.  So let John's age be x.  Then, Paul's age will be x + 10. 

The combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 100.  We know Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age.  So we can set up the equation:

x + x + 10 + Peter's age = 100

Peter's age = 100 - (x + x + 10) = 100 - 2x - 10 = 90 - 2x

We know Peter's age is also the sum of Paul and John's age, which is x + x + 10.  So we can set up another equation:

Peter's age = x + x + 10 = 2x + 10

This gives us two equations and two unknowns:

90 - 2x = 2x + 10

Combine like terms:

90 = 4x + 10

Subtract 10 from both sides:

80 = 4x

Divide both sides by 4:

20 = x

John's age is 20.  Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age, so:

Peter's age = 20 + 20 + 10 = 50

If he deposits 100 dollars, he will have 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left.  If he buys 5 pencils for 10 dollars each, that is 5 x 10 = 50 dollars.  So he has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left.  Each pen costs 25 dollars, so he can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens.  The answer is 4. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 

John earned 50 dollars per hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned a total of 50 x 6 = 300 dollars. 

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left. 

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left. 

Each pencil costs 10 dollars, and he wants to buy 5 pencils, so the total cost of pencils is 5 x 10 = 50 dollars.  After buying the pencils, he has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left. 

He can buy pens that cost 25 dollars each.  How many pens can he buy with 100 dollars? 100 divided by 25 is 4, so he can buy 4 pens. 

The answer is 4. 
1st part: John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours.  50 * 6 = 300 dollars.  If he spends 50 dollars on gas, he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.  He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left. 

2nd part: He has 150 dollars left, and wants to buy 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each.  That will be 5 x 10 = 50 dollars.  So he has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left. 

3rd part: With the remaining 100 dollars, he can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens.  The answer is 4. 
 Let's break it down!

John earns $50 per hour and works 6 hours, so he earns a total of $50 * 6 = $300. 

He spends $50 on gas, so he has $300 - $50 = $250 left. 

He wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so he has $250 - $100 = $150 left. 

He buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each, so he spends $5 * 10 = $50 on pencils.  This means he has $150 - $50 = $100 left. 

John can buy $100 ÷ $25 = 4 pens with the remaining $100.  The answer is 4. 
 John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned 50 * 6 = 300 dollars. 
He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left. 
He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he will have 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left. 
Now he can buy pens.  Each pen costs 25 dollars, so he can buy 150 ÷ 25 = 6 pens. 
He also buys 5 pencils, each costing 10 dollars, so he spends 5 * 10 = 50 dollars on pencils. 
The number of pens he can buy after buying pencils will be 6 - 2 = 4. 

The answer is 4 pens. 
 Let's follow the order of operations and solve the problem step by step. 

John earned 50 dollars per hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned a total of:

50 x 6 = 300 dollars

If he spends 50 dollars on gas, he has:

300 - 50 = 250 dollars left

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he'll have:

250 - 100 = 150 dollars left

He can buy pens that cost 25 dollars each.  To find out how many pens he can buy, we'll divide the remaining amount by the cost of one pen:

150 ÷ 25 = 6

He can buy 6 pens. 

However, the problem also mentions that he wants to buy pencils that cost 10 dollars each.  He wants to buy 5 pencils, so he'll spend:

5 x 10 = 50 dollars on pencils

Subtracting this amount from the remaining money, he'll have:

150 - 50 = 100 dollars left

With this remaining amount, he can still buy:

100 ÷ 25 = 4 pens

The answer is 4 pens. 
6 hours * 50 dollars per hour = 300 dollars total earned.  After spending 50 dollars on gas, he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars.  After depositing 100 dollars in the bank, he would have 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left.  So he would be left with 150 dollars to buy pens and pencils.  The 5 pencils for 10 dollars each would be 5 * 10 = 50 dollars, so he has 150 - 50 dollars left to buy pens.  150 - 50 is 100.  He can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens.  The answer is 4. 
 First, we need to calculate how much John earned in total for the week.  He earns 50 dollars per hour and worked for 6 hours, so he earned 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.  Then, he spent 50 dollars on gas.  300 - 50 = 250 dollars.  He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left.  If he wants to buy pens and pencils, he can buy pens worth 25 dollars each.  But we also need to account for the 5 pencils he bought that cost 10 dollars each.  5 * 10 = 50.  So 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left.  Finally, he can buy 100/25 = 4 pens.  The answer is 4. 
 First, John earned 50 dollars per hour, and worked 6 hours.  So he earned 50 x 6 = 300 dollars.  Then he spent 50 dollars on gas, leaving him with 300 - 50 = 250 dollars.  He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 250 - 100 = 150 dollars remaining.  How many 25 dollar pens can he buy with 150 dollars? Well, 150 divided by 25 is 6.

[EXP] 136: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

1.  James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.  20 * 0. 6 = 12.  So he swims 12 miles. 
2.  He swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, so it takes him 12/2 = 6 hours to swim 12 miles. 
3.  He rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6/2 = 3 hours. 
4.  He has 20 - 12 = 8 miles left to swim.  He swims at half his original speed, which is 2/2 = 1 mile per hour. 
5.  To swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour, it will take 8 hours. 

In total, James swims for 6 hours, rests for 3 hours, and then swims for 8 hours.  So the total time it takes him to get across the lake is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.  The answer is 17. 
 James swims 2 miles per hour, so he swims 20 * 0. 6 = 12 miles in 12/2 = 6 hours.  He rests for half that time, which is 3 hours.  Then he swims the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile/hr.  So, it takes him 8 hours to finish.  The total time is 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.  The answer is 17. 
 James has to swim across a 20-mile lake.  He can swim 2 miles per hour.  First, he swims 60% of the distance.  60% of 20 miles is 0. 6 * 20 = 12 miles.  It takes him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours to swim 12 miles. 

After that, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.  Then he swims the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.  He swims at half his original speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.  It takes him 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours to swim the remaining distance. 

So in total, he took 6 hours to swim 12 miles and 3 hours resting.  Then 8 hours to swim the remaining distance.  6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.  The answer is 17. 
 James swims at 2 miles per hour.  He swims 20 * 0. 6 = 12 miles.  It takes him 12 / 2 = 6 hours to swim.  Then he rests for 3 hours.  He still has 20 - 12 = 8 miles to go and swims at 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.  8 miles at 1 mph is 8 hours.  Adding up the time, it takes him 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.  The answer is 17. 
 Let's break this down step by step!

1.  James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0. 6 x 20 = 12 miles. 
2.  Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, it will take him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours to swim that distance. 
3.  James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours. 
4.  After resting, he has 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles left to swim. 
5.  Since he swims at half the speed (1 mile per hour) for the remaining distance, it will take him 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours to finish the remaining distance. 
6.  To find the total time, we add the time James spent swimming the first part, resting, and swimming the second part: 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours. 

The answer is 17 hours. 
 James starts with 20 miles to swim.  He swims 60% of the distance, which is 20 x 0. 6 = 12 miles.  The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.  James takes 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours to swim 12 miles.  Then he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.  He then swims the remaining 8 miles at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour.  It takes him 8 hours to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour.  So, in total it takes him 6 hours of swimming + 3 hours of resting + 8 hours of swimming = 17 hours.  The answer is 17. 
 James starts by swimming 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0. 6 * 20 = 12 miles.  At a pace of 2 miles per hour, it will take him 12/2 = 6 hours to swim this part.  After resting for half of that time, which is 6/2 = 3 hours, he swims the rest of the distance.  This is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.  He swims at half his original speed of 2 miles per hour, which is 1 mile per hour.  It will take him 8/1 = 8 hours to swim this part.  In total, he swam for 6 + 3 + 8 hours, which is 17 hours.  The answer is 17. 
 James swims 20 miles and swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.  60% of 20 is 0. 6 x 20 = 12 miles.  So he swims 12 miles.  The time it took him to swim 12 miles is 12/2 = 6 hours.  After that, he rests for half the time, which is 6/2 = 3 hours.  So he rested for 3 hours.  After that, he swims the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.  He swims at 1 mile per hour since it's half the original speed.  8/1 = 8 hours.  In total, it took him 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours to get across.  The answer is 17. 
 James has to swim 20 miles in total.  He swims 20 * 0. 6 = 12 miles at 2 miles per hour.  That will take him 12 / 2 = 6 hours to swim 12 miles.  He swims for 6 hours and rests for half that time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.  Then, he swims the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half his original speed, which is 1 mile per hour.  It will take him 8 hours to swim the remaining distance.  In total, James took 6 hours to swim the first part, rested for 3 hours, and swam for another 8 hours.  So, he took 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours to finish swimming the 20-mile lake.  The answer is 17. 
 First, James swims 60% of the distance.  20 * 0. 6 = 12.  He swims at 2 miles per hour, so the time it takes him to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.  Now he rests for half as long as the swimming time, so he rests for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.   The distance left is 8 miles (20 - 12 = 8).  He swims this distance at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour.   So it takes him 8 / 1 = 8 hours to swim this distance.   Therefore, the total time taken by James is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.  The answer is 17. 
 James has to swim 20 miles.  He swims 60% of 20 miles, which is 0. 6 x 20 = 12.  12 miles out of 20.  That takes 12 / 2 = 6 hours.  He rests for half as long as that, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.  He then has 8 miles left.  He swims that at half the speed, 1 mile per hour.  8 miles at 1 mile per hour takes 8 hours.  So in total, he spent 6 hours swimming, 3 resting, and 8 hours swimming.  6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.  The answer is 17. 
 First, James swims 60% of 20 miles, which is 60/100 * 20 = 12 miles.  The time he takes to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.  If he rests for half the time, that is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.  So he spent 6 + 3 = 9 hours swimming and resting.  The remaining distance to be swum is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.  At a pace of 1 mile per hour (since it's half the original pace), it would take him 8 hours.  Adding the time taken for the remaining distance, the total time taken to get across the lake is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.  The answer is 17. 
 Let's start by finding out how many miles James swam the first part of the lake.  The total distance is 20 miles, and he swam 60% of it, which is 20 * 0. 6 = 12 miles. 

It took him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours to swim that distance.  He rested for half that time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. 

The remaining distance to cross is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.  Since he swims at half the speed now, it will take him 8 miles / (2 miles per hour) * 2 hours per hour = 8 hours. 

So in total, it took James 6 hours to swim the first part, 3 hours to rest, and 8 hours to finish the remainder.  6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.  The answer is 17. 
 James loves to go swimming! Let's break this down step by step. 

Step 1: James swims 60% of the distance.  20 miles * 0. 6 = 12 miles. 

Step 2: He swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.  To find the time it takes to swim 12 miles, we can divide 12 miles by 2 miles per hour.  12 miles ÷ 2 miles per hour = 6 hours. 

Step 3: James then rests for half as long as the swimming time.  Half of 6 hours is 3 hours. 

Step 4: After resting, he finishes the remaining distance of 20 - 12 = 8 miles. 

Step 5: He swims at half the original speed, which is 1 mile per hour (2 miles per hour ÷ 2 = 1 mile per hour).  To find the time it takes to swim 8 miles, we can divide 8 miles by 1 mile per hour.  8 miles ÷ 1 mile per hour = 8 hours. 

Step 6: Now we add up the time it takes James to swim 12 miles, rest for 3 hours, and swim the remaining 8 miles.  6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming) = 17 hours. 

The answer is 17 hours. 
 First, James swims 60% of the distance, which is 0. 6 * 20 = 12 miles.  Since he swam 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour, it took him 12 ÷ 2 = 6 hours to swim the initial 12 miles.   Since he stopped resting for half as long as the swimming time, he rested for half of 6 hours, which is 3 hours.   Then, he swam the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at a pace of half his normal speed, or 1 mile per hour.   It took him 8 hours to swim the remaining distance. 
Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.   The answer is 17. 
1.  First, we need to find how much distance James swam in the beginning.  He swam 60% of the distance, so he swam 20 * 0. 60 = 12 miles.  
2.  The time it took him to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours. 
3.  On the island, he rested for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. 
4.  After the rest, James has 20 - 12 = 8 miles left to swim. 
5.  At this point, James goes half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour.  
6.  It will take him 8 hours to swim the remaining distance. 
7.  In total, James swam for 6 hours, rested for 3 hours, and swam the remaining distance for 8 hours.  So, in total, it took him 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours to get across the lake.  The answer is 17. 
 James started with a 20-mile lake.  After swimming 60% of the distance, which is 20 * 0. 6 = 12 miles, he will stop and rest.  

He swam for 12 miles at 2 miles per hour.  So that will take him 12 / 2 = 6 hours.  

He then rests for half the time that he swam.  So he rests for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.  

After resting, he still has 20 - 12 = 8 miles left to swim.  

He swims at half his original speed.  So he swims at 1 mile per hour.  

To swim 8 miles will take 8 hours.  

The total time it took him was 6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming at half speed) = 17 hours.  

The answer is 17. 
 James has to swim for 20 miles.  He swims 20 * 0. 6 = 12 miles (since 60% of the distance is 12 miles).  He spends some time resting on the island.  Since he swims 12 miles, that's 12/2 = 6 hours.  Then he spends half the time resting, which is 6/2 = 3 hours.  After resting, he has 20 - 12 = 8 miles left to swim.  He swims at half the speed, which is 2/2 = 1 mile per hour.  It takes 8 miles / 1 mph = 8 hours to swim the remaining distance.  So the total time is 6 (resting and swimming) + 3 (resting) + 8 (swimming additional distance) = 17 hours.  The answer is 17. 
1) James has to swim 20 miles.  
He can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour.  So the time it takes him to swim 1 mile is 1/2 hour.  
He has to swim 60% of the total distance, which is 60% * 20 = 12 miles.  
It will take him 6 hours to swim 12 miles.  

He then rests for half as long.  Half of 6 is 3 hours.  So he rests for 3 hours.  

Now, he has to swim the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.  He swims at half the speed, so that is 1 mile per hour.  
It will take him 8 hours to swim the remaining distance.  
The total time it took him to get across the lake is 6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (rest) + 8 hours (swimming) = 17 hours.  The answer is 17. 
1.  James has to swim 20 miles.  
   2.  After swimming 60% of 20 miles, he swims 20 * 0. 6 = 12 miles. 
   3.  So he swims for 12 miles at 2 miles per hour.  12/2 = 6 hours. 
   4.  He rests for half as long, so 6/2 = 3 hours. 
   5.  He finishes the remaining distance.  20 - 12 = 8.  8 miles at 1/2 of his speed is 1 mile per hour.  8/1 = 8 hours. 
   6.  Total time it took him to finish the remaining distance is 6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming again).  6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.  The answer is 17 hours.

[EXP] 137: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 360, [output]: 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.  Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, so he staples 30 * 4 = 120 reports every hour.  In 15 hours, Vince staples 120 * 15 = 1800 reports.  The answer is 1800. 
8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is a total of 15 hours.  For 15 minutes, Vince can staple 30 reports.  So in 1 hour, he can staple 30 * 4 = 120 reports.  Then in 15 hours, he can staple 120 * 15 = 1800 reports.  The answer is 1800. 
 First, find the number of hours Vince stapled reports.  11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours.  Since Vince staples 30 reports in 15 minutes, he staples 30 * 4 = 120 reports in one hour.  15 hours * 120 reports per hour = 1800 reports.  The answer is 1800. 
8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.  Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.  In 1 hour, Vince staples 60/15 = 4 times.  So in 15 hours, he staples 4 x 15 = 60 times.  If he staples 30 reports each time, he staples 60 * 30 = 1800 reports.  The answer is 1800. 
 Vince starts at 8:00 AM and stops at 11:00 PM.  There are 15 hours from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.  Since he staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, he staples reports for 4 times an hour (60 minutes divided by 15 minutes).  So in 15 hours, he staples 4 * 15 = 60 times.  Each time he staples 30 reports, so he staples 30 * 60 reports in total.  30 * 60 is 1800.  The answer is 1800. 
8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.  Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.  15 hours is 15 x 60 = 900 minutes.  900 / 15 = 60, so Vince staples 60 times in total.   Each time Vince staples 30 reports.  So the total number of reports he staples is 30 x 60 = 1800.  The answer is 1800. 
 Vince starts at 8:00 AM.  Until 11:00 PM, that is 15 hours.  He staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.  Let's find how many times he staples reports in those 15 hours.  15 hours is 15 x 60 = 900 minutes.  900 minutes is 900 / 15 = 60 times he staples reports.  60 times he staples 30 reports is 60 x 30 = 1800 reports.  The answer is 1800. 
15 minutes is the time it takes Vince to staple 30 reports.  

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.  

To change the hours to minutes, multiply by 60: 15 * 60 = 900 minutes. 

Now divide the total number of minutes by the time taken to staple one set of reports: 900 / 15 = 60 sets of reports. 

60 sets of reports means 60 * 30 reports = 1800 reports. 

The answer is 1800. 
 Let's break this down into smaller parts.  First, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 3 hours (11:00 AM - 8:00 AM).  11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours.  Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 15 hours is 15 x 60 = 900 minutes.  Dividing 900 minutes by 15 minutes per interval, we get 900 / 15 = 60 intervals.  Now, Vince staples 30 reports per interval.  30 reports per interval and 60 intervals means Vince will staple 30 x 60 = 1800 reports in total.  The answer is 1800. 
 Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.  We need to find out how many 15-minute time periods are in the given interval.  11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 60/15 = 4 time periods.  Vince was stapling reports for 15 hours x 4 time periods per hour = 60 time periods.  During each time period, Vince stapled 30 reports.  So, he stapled 60 x 30 = 1800 reports.  The answer is 1800. 
 This problem requires converting the time from hours to minutes, then calculating the total time in minutes, and then multiplying the number of reports Vince staples per minute by the total time. 

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, the total time is 15 hours.  We need to convert this to minutes, so 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes. 

Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, so we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals there are in 900 minutes.  900 / 15 = 60.

[EXP] 138: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Since Jason picked up and carried 2 balls, and he carried twice as many as Jeffrey, Jeffrey carried half of what Jason carried.  Half of 2 is 1.  So Jeffrey picked up and carried 1 ball. 

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried twice 2, which is 4 balls. 

In total, Jason, Jeffrey, and Jordan picked up and carried 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 balls.  Since they carried all the balls in one trip, this is equal to the total number of balls the coach brought to practice.  The answer is 7. 
 Let's start by using the information that Jason picked up and carried 2 balls.  Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 x 2 = 4 balls.  Jeffrey, who carried half as many balls as Jason, carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.  In total, they carried 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 balls.  Since they picked up all the balls in one trip, 7 is the total number of balls they picked up.  Therefore, the coach brought 7 balls to practice.  The answer is 7.

Let's start with Jason carrying 2 balls.  Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey must have carried half of Jason's, or 1 ball.  Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, she carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls. 

In total, they carried 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 balls.  Since they carried all the balls in one trip, that means that was the total number of balls the coach brought to practice.  The answer is 7. 
 Coach brought some balls in one bag and dumped them all out.  Then the 3 boys, Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey, picked up the balls.  Jason carried 2 balls.  Jordan carried twice as much as Jason, so 2 x 2 = 4 balls.  Jeffrey carried half as much as Jason, so 2 x 0. 5 = 1.  Together they picked up 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 balls.  This is for one trip, and they picked up all the balls, so this must be the total number of balls.  The answer is 7. 
 Let's start by identifying what we know:

* Jason carried 2 balls. 
* Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey must have carried half as many as Jason, which is 1 ball. 
* Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 4 balls (2 x 2). 

To find the total number of balls, we add up the number of balls each boy carried: 2 (Jason) + 1 (Jeffrey) + 4 (Jordan) = 7.  Since this is the number of balls the boys picked up, we add the number of balls Coach brought initially, which is also 7 (guess why?).  Coach brought 7 balls to practice. 

The answer is 7. 
 Coach brought some balls to practice.  Then he dumps them all out on the gym floor.  Then he asks three boys to pick them up.  The total number of balls they picked up is the same as the total number of balls Coach brought.  Let's find the number of balls each boy picked up and add them together. 

Jordan picked up 2x balls, where x is the number of balls Jason picked up.  Jason picked up 2 balls.  So Jordan picked up 2x = 2*2 = 4 balls.  Jordan picked up twice as many as Jason, so Jason picked up half of what Jordan picked up.  Jason picked up 2 balls, so Jordan picked up 4 balls.  Jeffrey picked up half of what Jason picked up, so he picked up half of 2 balls which is 1 ball. 

So in total, the boys picked up 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 balls.  This means the coach brought 7 balls to practice.  The answer is 7. 
2 balls were carried by Jason.  Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried 1 ball.  Twice Jason's amount is what Jordan carried, so 2 x 2 = 4 balls were carried by Jordan.  In total, 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 balls were carried by the boys.  The coach had more balls, which are still in the bag.  If the boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip, that means they carried all of them.  So the coach must have brought 7 more balls initially.  Since coach arrived with 1 bag, that bag must be filled with 7 balls.  The answer is 7. 
 There were 3 boys picking up the balls.  Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey.  To make it easier, let's give Jason 2 balls.  Let's give Jeffrey 1 ball.  That means Jordan has 2 * 2 = 4 balls. 

In total, they carried 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 balls.  This was their one trip.  So, the coach must have brought 7 x 1 = 7 bags of balls.  But the question said there was only 1 bag filled with basketballs.  So, each bag must have 7 balls.  Since the coach dumped all the balls out onto the floor, that means he brought 7 balls.  The answer is 7. 
 Since Jason picked up and carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey must have picked up and carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.  Jason also carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jordan picked up and carried 1 x 2 = 2 balls.  In total, 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 balls were picked up.  The coach originally brought an unknown number of balls which, when added to 5, will equal the total number of balls he brought.  Let's call this unknown number x.  So, we can write the equation: x + 5 = total balls.  We know Jason picked up 2 balls, so the total number of balls is 2 more than the number of balls Jason picked up.  Since Jordan picked up twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan picked up 2 x 2 = 4.  We also know Jeffrey picked up 1 ball.  Adding all the balls together gives us: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.  So the total number of balls is 5.  The equation we set up earlier is: x + 5 = total balls.  We know the total number of balls is 5, so the equation becomes: x + 5 = 5.  Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us x = 0.  So, the coach brought 0 balls.  However, this seems impossible because the 3 boys picked up and carried a total of 5 balls.  Therefore, this is not the correct solution.  The correct solution must be that Jason picked up 2 balls and Jeffrey picked up 1 ball, which is 3 balls.  That leaves x = total balls - 3 = total balls.  We know Jason picked up 2 balls, so the total number of balls is 2 more than the number of balls Jason picked up.  That is 2 + balls.  Similarly, since Jordan picked up twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan picked up 2 x 2 = 4 balls.  We also know Jeffrey picked up 1 ball.  So the total number of balls is 2 + 1 + 4 = 7.  The coach brought 7 balls to practice.  The answer is 7.

 There are 50 states in the USA.  If India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, then it has 4 + 50/2 = 4 + 25 = 29 states.  To find the total, we add the 50 US states to the 29 Indian states: 50 + 29 = 79.  The answer is 79. 
 The US has 50 states.  Half of 50 is 25.  So, India has 4 more than 25 states.  25 + 4 = 29 states.  To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add them up: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.  The answer is 79. 
 Every country must have its own unique number of states.  The information we are given is the number of states in India, not the USA.  If India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, then we can set up the equation:

India = 4 + 1/2 * Number of States in USA

This equation is not useful to find the total number of states in both countries together. 

Let's try a different approach.  We can first find the number of states in India.  We know that the number of states in USA is 50.  

Let's find half of 50:

50 / 2 = 25

Then we can find the number of states in India by adding 4 to half of 50:

25 + 4 = 29

So India has 29 states.  

If we know the number of states in both countries, we can add them together:

29 (states in India) + 50 (states in USA) = 79

The answer is 79.

Igneous howls for the combined time of both of them, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  So the total time is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.  There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we have to convert 120 seconds to minutes.  120 / 60 = 2 minutes.  The answer is 2. 
 Tobias howls for 20 seconds.  Chikote howls for twice as long, so Chikote howls for 20 * 2 = 40 seconds.  Igneous howls for as long as the other two combined.  Tobias howls for 20 seconds, and Chikote howls for 40 seconds, so the combined time of the other two is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  Since Igneous howls for the same amount of time, the total time of all three wolves howling is 60 + 40 + 20 = 120 seconds.  There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 120 seconds is 2 minutes.  The answer is 2. 
 Let's start by calculating the length of each wolf's howl:

* Tobias's howl lasts for 20 seconds. 
* Chikote's howl is twice as long as Tobias's, so it lasts for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds. 
* Igneous's howl lasts for as long as the other two wolves combined, so it lasts for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds. 

To find the combined length of time, we add the lengths of each wolf's howl: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds. 

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 ÷ 60 = 2 minutes. 

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes. 

The answer is 2. 
 Let's start by finding out how long Chikote howls.  If Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, and Tobias howls for 20 seconds, then Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds. 

Next, let's find out how long Igneous howls.  Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 (Tobias's howl) + 40 (Chikote's howl) seconds.  That's a total of 60 seconds. 

So, in total, the three wolves howl for 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.  To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute).  120 seconds ÷ 60 is 2 minutes. 

The answer is 2. 
 Tobias's howls are 20 seconds long.  Chikote's howls are twice as long, so they are 20 * 2 = 40 seconds long.  Igneous howls for as long as the other two combined, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  So overall, the total time is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.  However, we need to convert to minutes.  There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 120 seconds is 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.  The answer is 2. 
 There are three wolves, each howling.  Tobias howls for 20 seconds, Chikote for 20 * 2 = 40 seconds, and Igneous for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  That's 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds total.  We need to convert seconds to minutes, by dividing 120 by 60.  120 divided by 60 = 2.   The answer is 2. 
 Let's analyze the situation:
Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long, which is 2 x 20 = 40 seconds. 
Igneous howls for as long as both Tobias and Chikote combined, which is (20 + 40) = 60 seconds. 

Total howling time: 
Tobias + Chikote + Igneous = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds. 
 Convert seconds to minutes: 
1 minute = 60 seconds, so 120 seconds is 120 / 60 = 2 minutes. 
The answer is 2 minutes. 
 This problem asks us to find the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls.  Tobias howls for 20 seconds, Chikote for 2 times as long (20 x 2 = 40) and Igneous for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds (the total of the other two).  The combined time is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.  Convert this to minutes: 120 / 60 = 2.  The answer is 2. 
 Tobias' howl lasts 20 seconds.  Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote's howl lasts 2 x 20 = 40 seconds.  Both howls combined is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  Igneous' howl lasts as long as the other two wolves combined.  So it lasts 60 seconds.  The total combined howl time is 60 seconds for Tobias and Chikote plus 60 seconds for Igneous.  Total combined howl time is 60 + 60 = 120 seconds.  To find the total time in minutes, divide the total seconds by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute).  120 / 60 = 2.  The answer is 2 minutes. 
 We can find the total time howled by each wolf:

Tobias: 20 seconds
Chikote: 2 * 20 = 40 seconds
Igneous: 20 + 40 = 60 seconds (since it is equal to the total time of the other two)

Now, we need to add all these times in seconds to get the total.  20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds. 

Since we are looking for the answer in minutes, 120 seconds is equal to 2 minutes. 

The answer is 2 minutes. 
 First, let's find the length of Chikote's howl.  His howl lasts for twice as long as Tobias's, so Chikote's howl is 2 x 20 = 40 seconds.  

Now, we are told that Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  That means Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  

Since Tobias howls for 20 seconds, Chikote for 40 seconds, and Igneous for 60 seconds, their total howling time is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.  

To find the howling time in minutes, we divide 120 seconds by 60, since there are 60 seconds in a minute.  120/60 = 2 minutes. 

The answer is 2 minutes.

[EXP] 144: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Let's break down the time it takes to make the cake:

* 20 minutes to make the cake batter
* 30 minutes to bake the cake
* 2 hours to cool the cake
* 10 minutes to frost the cake

Total time needed to make the cake: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

To be ready to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, Jordan needs to start making the cake at the latest at:

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

The answer is 2:00 pm. 
20 minutes to make the cake batter, 30 minutes to bake the cake, 2 hours to cool the cake, and 10 minutes to frost the cake would be a total of:

20 + 30 + 2 hours + 10 = 62 minutes + 2 hours = 2 hours 62 minutes

Adding these minutes to the time, we get:

5:00 pm - 2 hours 62 minutes = 2:38 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 2:38 pm.  The answer is 2:38 pm. 
 Let's break down the time it takes to make the cake into parts:

* 20 minutes for making the cake batter
* 30 minutes for baking the cake
* 2 hours for cooling the cake
* 10 minutes for frosting the cake

Total time to make the cake = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

180 minutes = 3 hours

Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, so she can't start making it later than 2:00 pm, since 3 hours before 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.  The answer is 2:00 pm. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step.  It takes 20 minutes to make the cake batter, 30 minutes to bake the cake, 2 hours to cool, and an additional 10 minutes to frost the cake.  

The total time needed to make the cake is 20 + 30 + 2 * 60 + 10 = 140 minutes = 2 hours and 20 minutes. 

To be ready to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, Jordan needs to start making the cake by the earliest time 5:00 pm - 2 hours 20 minutes = 2:40 pm. 

The answer is 2:40 pm. 
20 minutes for cake batter, 30 minutes to bake, 2 hours to cool, and 10 minutes to frost.  20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.  To convert minutes to hours, 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.  So 3 hours = 3:00 pm.  It will be ready to serve at 5:00, so Jordan should start making the cake at 2:00 pm.  The answer is 2:00 pm. 
 The process of making the cake will take 20 minutes for the batter, 30 minutes for baking, 2 hours (120 minutes) for cooling, and 10 minutes for frosting.  In total, it will take 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes to make the cake. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so it will take 180 / 60 = 3 hours to make the cake. 

The cake needs to be ready at 5:00 pm, and it will take 3 hours to make.  So we must subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm to find the latest time to start making the cake. 

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

The answer is 2:00 pm. 
 Let's calculate the total time required to make the cake: 
20 minutes for the batter, 
30 minutes for baking, 
2 hours for cooling, and
10 minutes for frosting. 

The total time is 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes. 

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours.  
To be ready to serve at 5:00 pm, Jordan should start making the cake at 2:00 pm, since that leaves enough time to complete the steps. 

The answer is 2:00 pm. 
 Jordan will need to spend a total of:

20 (minutes for cake batter) + 30 (minutes for baking) + 120 (minutes for cooling) + 10 (minutes for frosting) = 180 minutes
Let's convert minutes to hours: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours
She will need 3 hours to make the cake.   She plans to make the cake by 5:00 pm.   So she should start making the cake at 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.   The answer is 2:00 pm. 
 Jordan wants to make the cake and have it ready by 5:00 pm.  There are several steps needed before the cake is ready.  She spends 20 minutes on the cake batter, 30 minutes baking the cake, 2 hours cooling the cake, and 10 minutes to frost the cake.  So in total, the process takes 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.  Converting this to hours, 180 minutes = 180 / 60 = 3 hours. 

Jordan needs to start making the cake at the latest 3 hours before 5:00 pm.  To find this time, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm.  5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.  The answer is 2:00 pm.

15 packs with 60 pieces each is a total of 15 * 60 = 900 pieces.  Anne kept 2 packs so the number of pieces she didn't give away is 2 * 60 = 120.  900 - 120 = 780.  Anne gave the rest, or 780 pieces, to her 10 friends.  So, each friend got 780 / 10 = 78.  The answer is 78. 
15 packs * 60 pieces per pack is 15 * 60 = 900 pieces in total.  Anne kept 2 packs, so she kept 60 * 2 = 120 pieces.  The rest, 900 - 120 = 780, is distributed to her friends.  780 is divided equally among 10 friends.  So 780 ÷ 10 = 78.  The answer is 78. 
15 packs multiplied by 60 pieces per pack gives a total of 15 x 60 = 900 pieces of sweets.  If Anne kept two packs, that is 2 x 60 = 120 pieces she kept.  The rest of the sweets, 900 - 120 = 780 pieces, she gave to her 10 friends.  To find out how many sweets each friend received, we do 780 ÷ 10 = 78.  The answer is 78. 
15 packs times 60 pieces in each pack is 15 x 60 = 900 pieces of sweets.  Anne kept 2 packs, which means she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends.  13 packs times 60 pieces per pack is 13 x 60 = 780 pieces of sweets.  Dividing 780 pieces of sweets equally among 10 friends each, each friend gets 780 ÷ 10 = 78 pieces.  The answer is 78. 
15 packs in the box.  Anne kept 2 packs, so there are 15 - 2 = 13 packs left.  There are 60 pieces in each pack, so the total number of pieces left is 13 * 60 = 780.  Since the remaining 13 packs were divided equally among Anne's 10 friends, they received 780 / 10 = 78 pieces each.  The answer is 78. 
15 packs in the box.  2 packs were kept by Anne.  That leaves 15 - 2 = 13 packs.  These 13 packs are given to Anne's 10 friends equally.  13 packs will have 13 * 60 = 780 pieces of sweets.  To distribute these 780 pieces equally among 10 friends, we divide 780 by 10.  780 / 10 = 78.  The answer is 78.

[EXP] 147: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a large stuffed animal is 4 x 3 = 12 dollars. 

We know Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.  Let's say x is the number of large stuffed animals she sold.  Then she sold 2x small stuffed animals. 

She earned $120 from the sales.  The total amount earned from selling large stuffed animals is 12x.  The total amount earned from selling small stuffed animals is 4(2x) = 8x.  Since she earned a total of $120, we can set up the equation:

12x + 8x = 120

Combine like terms:

20x = 120

Divide by 20:

x = 6

So Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals.  Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals, she sold 2x = 12 small stuffed animals. 

The answer is 12. 
 Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Small stuffed animals cost $4 each. 
* Large stuffed animals are three times the price of small stuffed animals, so they cost $12 each. 
* Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. 
* She earned a total of $120 from the sales. 

We can start by using the information about the prices of the stuffed animals.  Let's say she sold x large stuffed animals and 2x small stuffed animals (since she sold twice as many small ones). 

The revenue from the sales can be calculated as follows:

* Small stuffed animals: 2x x $4 = 8x
* Large stuffed animals: x x $12 = 12x
* Total revenue: 8x + 12x = 20x

We know that the total revenue is $120, so we can set up the equation:

20x = 120

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 20:

x = 120 / 20
x = 6

So Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals.  Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x = 2(6) = 12 small stuffed animals. 

The answer is 12. 
 Let's start by using the information that Teresa earns $120 from the sales.  We know that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so let's say she sold x large stuffed animals and 2x small stuffed animals. 

We also know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals.  So, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal.  Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 x $4 = $12. 

We know that Teresa earned $120 from the sales, so the total amount she earned from selling small and large stuffed animals is equal to $120.  This can be represented by the equation:

2x(4) + x(12) = 120

Combine like terms:

8x + 12x = 120

Combine the x terms:

20x = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 6

So Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals.  Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 6 x 2 = 12 small stuffed animals.  The answer is 12. 
 Let's use variables to represent the unknowns.  Let the number of small stuffed animals sold be x.  Then, the number of large stuffed animals sold is x/2.  Each small stuffed animal costs $4, so the total revenue from small stuffed animals is 4x.  Each large stuffed animal is sold three times the price of a small one, so the revenue from large stuffed animals is 4 * 3 * x/2 = 6x.  The total revenue from sales is $120, which is the sum of the revenue from small and large stuffed animals: 4x + 6x = 120.  Combining like terms, 10x = 120.  Dividing both sides by 10 gives x = 12.  Since x is the number of small stuffed animals sold, the answer is 12. 
 We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.  Let's say x be the number of large stuffed animals.  Then, 2x is the number of small ones.  

Each large stuffed animal costs 3 times the price of a small one, so the total revenue from large stuffed animals is 3x times the price of a small one.  

The total revenue is given as 120, so we can set up an equation:
4(2x) + 3x(4) = 120

Combine like terms:
8x + 12x = 120
20x = 120
x = 6

So she sold 6 large stuffed animals.  Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals, she sold 6 * 2 = 12 small stuffed animals. 

The answer is 12. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's assume Teresa sells x large stuffed animals.  Since she sells twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sells 2x small stuffed animals. 

Teresa sells each large stuffed animal for three times the price of small stuffed animals, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal. 

Let's say the price of a small stuffed animal is 4 dollars (we know this from the problem statement).  Then the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 x 4 = 12 dollars. 

So, Teresa earns 12x dollars from large stuffed animals and 8x dollars from small stuffed animals (since each small stuffed animal costs 4 dollars).  

In total, she earns 12x + 8x = 20x dollars. 

We know she earns 120 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

20x = 120

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 20:

x = 120 / 20
x = 6

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals and 2x = 2(6) = 12 small stuffed animals. 

The answer is 12. 
 Let's start by finding the price of large stuffed animals.  If small stuffed animals cost $4 each, and large stuffed animals are three times the price, then large stuffed animals cost $4 x 3 = $12 each.  She sold twice as many small as large stuffed animals, so let's call the number of large stuffed animals x.  That means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.  Since the cost of a small stuffed animal is $4, the total cost of small stuffed animals is 2x x 4 = 8x.  She earned $120 total from the sales, so the revenue from selling the small stuffed animals is 8x.  The cost of large stuffed animals is 12x, so the revenue from selling large stuffed animals is 12x.  Since revenue from both is equal to $120, we can set up the equation 8x + 12x = 120.  Combine like terms: 20x = 120.  Divide both sides by 20: x = 6.  So she sold 6 large stuffed animals.  Since she sold twice as many small as large, she sold 2x = 2(6) = 12 small stuffed animals.  The answer is 12. 
 Let's analyze the information we have. 
- The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals. 
- Each small stuffed animal costs $4. 
- Therefore, the price of large stuffed animals is 3 x 4 = 12 dollars. 
- Teresa sold 2 times as many small stuffed animals as large ones. 
- Let's call the number of large stuffed animals x. 
- Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold = 2x. 
- The total amount earned is $120. 
- The revenue from large stuffed animals is the number of large stuffed animals multiplied by their price. 
- The revenue from small stuffed animals is the number of small stuffed animals multiplied by the price, which is 4 dollars each. 
- We can set up the equation: 12x + 4(2x) = 120.  
- Simplify the equation: 12x + 8x = 120.  
- Combine like terms: 20x = 120.  
- Divide both sides by 20: x = 6. 
- Since x is the number of large stuffed animals, we multiply x by 2 to get the number of small stuffed animals sold: 2x = 2(6) = 12. 
- The answer is 12. 
 Let’s start by using the information given.  Each small stuffed animal costs $4.  We are looking for how many small stuffed animals Teresa sold.  We know that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, and she sold a total of x large and 2x small stuffed animals.  Total earnings is $120, and each large one sells for 3 * 4 = 12 dollars, and each small one sells for 4 dollars.  So the total earnings is 12x + 4(2x) = 12x + 8x = 20x. 

We are told that the total earnings is 120 dollars, so 20x = 120.  Divide both sides by 20 to get x = 6. 

So Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals, which is half the number of small stuffed animals she sold.  She sold twice as many small as large, so 6 * 2 = 12.  She sold 12 small stuffed animals.  The answer is 12. 
 first, we can find the price of large stuffed animals.  Since Teresa sells them for 3 times the price of small ones, and small ones are 4 dollars each, large ones will be 4 * 3 = 12 dollars each.  

Now, we know she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned 120 dollars.  Let x be the number of large stuffed animals she sold.  Then, she must have sold 2x small stuffed animals.  

The total money earned from sales is $120.  The money earned from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.  The money earned from small ones is 4 * 2x = 8x, because there were twice as many small ones as large ones.  The total money earned is the sum of these two amounts: 12x + 8x = 20x.  We know this is equal to 120, so we can set up the equation 20x = 120 and solve for x.  

20x = 120 

x = 6

So Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals.  But we are asked to find the number of small stuffed animals she sold.  Since she sold twice as many small ones as large ones, we can multiply 6 by 2 to get the number of small ones: 6 * 2 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
1st part of the problem: Large stuffed animals sell for 3 times the price of small stuffed animals.  Let's find the price of a large stuffed animal.  If small stuffed animals sell for $4, and large stuffed animals sell for 3 times that, then a large stuffed animal would be 3 x $4 = $12.  

2nd part of the problem: She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $120 from sales.  Let's call the number of large stuffed animals 'L'.  Then the number of small stuffed animals would be 2L.  She earned $120.  Let's find out how the money can be distributed.  She gets $4 per small stuffed animal.  

So for 2L small stuffed animals, she would get 2L * $4 = $8L. 
She also gets $12 per large stuffed animal.  For 'L' large stuffed animals, she would get 'L' * $12 = $12L. 

Total amount earned is the sum of the money from small and large stuffed animals: $8L + $12L = $20L. 

This total amount equals $120, so we need to solve $20L = $120. 

Divide both sides by 20 to get L = $120 / 20 = $6. 

L equals the number of large stuffed animals she sold. 
But we also know that small stuffed animals sell twice as much as large ones.  So the number of small stuffed animals is 2 times the number of large stuffed animals, 2 * $6 = 12. 

This is the number of small stuffed animals she sold.  The answer is 12.

Each large stuffed animal is sold three times the price of a small one, so the revenue from large stuffed animals is 4 * 3 * x/2 = 6x.  The total revenue from sales is $120, which is the sum of the revenue from small and large stuffed animals: 4x + 6x = 120.  Combining like terms, 10x = 120.  Dividing both sides by 10 gives x = 12.

She sold twice as many small as large stuffed animals, so let's call the number of large stuffed animals x.  That means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.  Since the cost of a small stuffed animal is $4, the total cost of small stuffed animals is 2x x 4 = 8x.  She earned $120 total from the sales, so the revenue from selling the small stuffed animals is 8x.  The cost of large stuffed animals is 12x, so the revenue from selling large stuffed animals is 12x.  Since revenue from both is equal to $120, we can set up the equation 8x + 12x = 120.  Combine like terms: 20x = 120.  Divide both sides by 20: x = 6.  So she sold 6 large stuffed animals.  Since she sold twice as many small as large, she sold 2x = 2(6) = 12 small stuffed animals.

Total earnings is $120, and each large one sells for 3 * 4 = 12 dollars, and each small one sells for 4 dollars.  So the total earnings is 12x + 4(2x) = 12x + 8x = 20x. \n\nWe are told that the total earnings is 120 dollars, so 20x = 120.

The money earned from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.  The money earned from small ones is 4 * 2x = 8x, because there were twice as many small ones as large ones.  The total money earned is the sum of these two amounts: 12x + 8x = 20x.

Let's call the number of large stuffed animals 'L'.  Then the number of small stuffed animals would be 2L.  She earned $120.  Let's find out how the money can be distributed.  She gets $4 per small stuffed animal.  \n\nSo for 2L small stuffed animals, she would get 2L * $4 = $8L. \nShe also gets $12 per large stuffed animal.  For 'L' large stuffed animals, she would get 'L' * $12 = $12L. \n\nTotal amount earned is the sum of the money from small and large stuffed animals: $8L + $12L = $20L. \n\nThis total amount equals $120, so we need to solve $20L = $120. \n\nDivide both sides by 20 to get L = $120 / 20 = $6. \n\nL equals the number of large stuffed animals she sold. \nBut we also know that small stuffed animals sell twice as much as large ones.  So the number of small stuffed animals is 2 times the number of large stuffed animals, 2 * $6 = 12. \n\nThis is the number of small stuffed animals she sold.  The answer is 12. "]

She lost half of 12, which is 6 yellow balloons, so she now has 34 - 6 = 28 balloons.  She found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them.  8 * 0. 75 = 6, so she added 6 blue balloons.  28 + 6 = 34 balloons.  The answer is 34. 
 Sally started with 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.  So, there are 25 + 7 + 12 = 44 balloons in total.  40% of the red balloons burst, so that's 25 - (0. 4 * 25) = 15 red balloons left.  Half of the yellow balloons got released, so that's 12 - (0. 5 * 12) = 6 yellow balloons left.  75% of the blue balloons were added, so 0. 75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons were added.  In total, Sally carries 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 balloons into the school.  The answer is 34. 
 Let's break down the problem step by step:

1.  Sally started with 25 red balloons.  40% of them burst, so she lost 25 x 0. 4 = 10 red balloons.  She is left with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons. 
2.  She has 7 green balloons, which remain the same. 
3.  She has 12 yellow balloons originally.  Half of them accidentally released, so she lost 12/2 = 6 yellow balloons.  She has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left. 
4.  She finds 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and adds 75% of them to her remaining balloons.  8 x 0. 75 = 6 blue balloons are added.  She now has 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons.  In total, she has 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 balloons. 

The answer is 34. 
 Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.  So she had 25 + 7 + 12 = 44 balloons total.  40% of the 25 red balloons burst, so 25 x 0. 4 = 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.  
Half of the 12 yellow balloons burst, so 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons burst, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.  
She now had 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 6 yellow balloons.  So she had 15 + 7 + 6 = 28 balloons left.  
Adding 75% of the 8 blue balloons is 8 x 0. 75 = 6 blue balloons.  28 + 6 = 34.  The answer is 34. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

1.  Sally started with 25 red balloons.  40% of 25 is 0. 4*25 = 10, so 10 red balloons burst.  25 - 10 = 15 red balloons remain. 

2.  She still held 7 green balloons, which is unchanged. 

3.  She started with 12 yellow balloons.  Half of 12 is 12/2 = 6, so 6 yellow balloons were released.  12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons remain. 

4.  She added 75% of 8 blue balloons (0. 75*8 = 6) to her remaining clutch.  She started with 15 red, 7 green, 6 yellow, and 6 blue balloons.  15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 balloons.  The answer is 34.

Half of the 12 yellow balloons burst, or 6 yellow balloons burst.  So she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left, 7 green balloons, and 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.  Then she added 75% of the 8 blue balloons.  75% of 8 is 6, so she added 6 blue balloons.  15 + 7 + 6 + 6 is 34.  The answer is 34. 
 Sally started with 25 red balloons.  40% of the red balloons burst, leaving 100% - 40% = 60% of the red balloons.  0. 6 * 25 = 15.  She burst 10 red balloons.  Now, she has 15 red balloons. 

Sally has 7 green balloons and 12 yellow balloons.  Half of the yellow balloons burst, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons. 

Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch.  0. 75 * 8 = 6.  She added 6 blue balloons, now having 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons.  In total, she had 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 balloons. 

The answer is 34. 
 Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons to begin with.  First, 40% of the red balloons burst, which means 0. 4 x 25 = 10 red balloons burst.  So she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left. 
Since half of the yellow balloons burst, that means 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons burst, and she had 12 - 6 = 6 remaining. 
The 8 blue balloons she found were 7. 5% of 10, because 75% of 8 is 6 and 6 + 4 = 10. 
In total, she had 15 red, 7 green, 6 yellow, and 6 blue balloons.  15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34.  The answer is 34.

* Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.  Half of 12 is 12 ÷ 2 = 6.  So, 6 yellow balloons were released. 
That left Sally with:
* 15 red balloons
* 7 green balloons
* 6 yellow balloons

Then, she found 8 blue balloons but was only able to add 75% of them.  75% of 8 is 8 x 0. 75 = 6.  So, she added 6 blue balloons. 

The total number of balloons Sally finally carried into school is:
15 red + 7 green + 6 yellow + 6 blue = 34 balloons

[EXP] 154: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 251, [output]: 25 classmates + 7 girls in dance class + 13 family members = 45 total invited guests.  Only 4 could not come, so Kayla will have 45 - 4 = 41 guests.  The fee to rent the theater for 20 people is 125 dollars.  Then for each of 21 people, 6 dollars more will be added.  21 people is 41 - 20 = 21.  So 6 * 21 = 126 dollars.  126 + 125 = 251 dollars.  The answer is 251. 
 The party started with 20 guests.  Then there were 25 classmates and 7 dance class friends, so that is a total of 25 + 7 = 32 guests.  Plus 13 family members, so 32 + 13 = 45 guests in total.  4 people declined, so 45 - 4 = 41 guests actually attended.  The fee is $125 for the first 20 guests, and then $6 per guest.  So the extra guests cost 41 - 20 = 21 guests, and 21 * 6 = 126 dollars.  In total, it will cost 125 + 126 = 251.  The answer is 251 dollars. 
 First, we need to find the total number of guests.  Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 dance class members and 13 family members.  But 4 people said they could not come.  So the total number of guests is 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41. 

There is a base fee of 125 dollars and the additional fee is 6 dollars for each guest.  There were 41 guests.  The additional fee will be 6 * 21 = 126 dollars (since we count the base number of guests, 20, and the additional 21 guests). 

So the total cost is 125 (base fee) + 126 (additional fee) = 251 dollars.  The answer is 251. 
20 guests is the base cost and it is 125 dollars.  For each additional 1 guest, it is 6 dollars.  For 4 guests who could not come, we don't have to pay for them.  For the 25 classmates and 7 dance class girls and 13 family members, we have a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.  Out of them, 4 couldn't come so we are left with 45 - 4 = 41 guests.  For these 41 - 20 = 21 extra guests, we have to pay 21 * 6 = 126 dollars.  125 + 126 is 251.  The answer is 251 dollars. 
 Kayla wants to have her birthday party at a theater.  A party of 20 costs $125, and then there's an additional $6 for each extra guest.  Altogether, there will be 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41 guests.  Of these, 20 were included in the initial fee, and the rest will be charged extra.  So, the extra amount will be 41 - 20 = 21 guests.  The extra guests will be charged 21 * $6 = $126.  The initial fee plus the extra fee will be $125 + $126 = $251.  The answer is 251. 
 Kayla is having a party at a theater.  The fee is 125 for 20 people and 6 dollars more for each additional guest.  First, let's find the number of additional guests.  Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls in her dance class, as well as 13 family members.  This is 25 + 7 + 13 = 45.  So, there are 45 people for the party, minus the 4 guests who said they could not come.  That is 45 - 4 = 41.  Then we subtract the 20 people for which the initial fee was 125 and get 41 - 20 = 21 people for which we need to pay extra.  So the total fee is 125 + (21 * 6) = 125 + 126 = 251.  The answer is 251.

First, let's count the number of guests who will come to the party.  Kayla originally invited 25 classmates + 7 girls from her dance class + 13 family members = 45 guests.  But 4 people couldn't come, so there will be 45 - 4 = 41 guests in total. 

The base fee is $125 for 20 guests, so we need to know the number of guests above 20.  41 - 20 = 21, so there are 21 extra guests.  The fee is $6 per extra guest, so that is 21 x 6 = 126 dollars.  Adding the base fee of 125 and the extra fee of 126, the total fee is 125 + 126 = 251.  The answer is 251. 
 Kayla will invite 25 classmates and 7 dance class friends, and 13 family members.  So, 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests total.  But 4 cannot come, so it's 45 - 4 = 41 guests. 
The basic fee is 125 dollars, and there are 41 guests in total.  For each additional guest, there is an additional fee of 6 dollars.  Let's figure out how many guests above the basic 20:

41 (total guests) - 20 (basic guests) = 21 additional guests. 
The additional fee will be 21 x 6 = 126 dollars.  The total cost will be the basic fee and the additional fee:

125 + 126 = 251 dollars. 

The answer is 251. 
 Kayla originally would have 20 guests, which is already paid for in the rental fee.  There are 25 classmates and 7 girls in her dance class, and 13 family members.  But 4 people said they couldn't come, so 25 + 7 - 4 + 13 = 41 people are actually going.  The rental fee is already paid, so Kayla has to pay for each of these 41 guests for the additional fee.  41 - 20 is 21 additional people, and each costs $6, so that is 21 x 6 = 126 dollars.  126 + 125 dollars is 251 dollars.  The answer is 251.

4 years ago, the crocodile grew 8 inches.  That means every year, the crocodile grows 8 / 4 = 2 inches.  If it will grow for 13 years, then it will grow 2 x 13 = 26 inches.  The answer is 26. 
8 inches per 4 years means 8/4 = 2 inches per year.  To grow to 13 years, the crocodile will grow 2 * 13 = 26 inches.  The answer is 26. 
8 inches growth in 4 years means the crocodile grows 8 / 4 inches per year.  So it grows 2 inches per year. 

In 13 years, it will grow 2 inches per year * 13 years = 26 inches. 

The answer is 26. 
8 inches in 4 years is a rate of 8/4 = 2 inches per year.  To find how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the rate (2 inches/year) by the time (13 years), 2 * 13 = 26.  The answer is 26 inches. 
 The crocodile grows 8 inches long every 4 years, so it grows 2 inches every 1 year.  For 13 years, it will grow 2 x 13 inches, which is 26 inches.  The answer is 26 inches. 
 The crocodile grows 8 inches every 4 years.  To find the rate at which it grows per year, we can divide 8 by 4, which gives 2.  So the crocodile grows 2 inches per year. 

To find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we can multiply its growth rate per year by 13: 2 x 13 = 26.  The answer is 26. 
 Since the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can find the rate at which it grows by dividing 8 inches by 4 years, which gives us 2 inches per year.

[EXP] 157: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1080, [output]: 270 kilograms of meat was left for the lazy Allosaurus.  Before that, there was half of that amount left (since velociraptors ate half of what was left).  So before velociraptors, there were 2 x 270 = 540 kilograms of meat left.  Before Tyrannosaurus rex, there was twice that amount (since it ate half).  2 x 540 = 1080.  The answer is 1080. 
270 kg is the amount left after the Tyrannosaurus rex and velociraptors ate.  Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the Tyrannosaurus rex, the amount left after the Tyrannosaurus rex ate is 2 x 270 = 540 kg.  Since the instance of 540 kg is half of the original amount, the original amount is 2 x 540 = 1080 kg. 
The answer is 1080 kg. 
270 kilograms is the last remaining meat.  Before that, it was half eaten by velociraptors, so they ate half of what was left.  So they ate 1/2 * 540 = 270.  This means that 540 kilograms was left.  Before that, it was half eaten by the T-Rex.  So the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops.  So the triceratops weighed 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.  The answer is 1080. 
 A Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of a small triceratops, and a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left.   That means only 1/4 of the triceratops is left after the velociraptors ate.  
The lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kg of meat, which is the remaining 1/4 of the triceratops.  
Since 1/4 of the triceratops is 270 kg, the whole triceratops must have been 4 x 270 = 1080 kg.  
The answer is 1080. 
1) A Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the triceratops.  So there is half of the meat left.  2) Half of what was left was eaten by velociraptors.  So, the second half of what was left was eaten.  So there is a quarter of the triceratops left.  3) The final amount of meat left is 270 kilograms.  So the quarter of the triceratops is 270 kilograms.  To find the triceratops, we need to multiply 270 by 4.  270 * 4 = 1080.  The answer is 1080. 
270 kilograms of meat is left.  Then, a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left by the T Rex.  So, before the velociraptors got there, there were 2 times 270 kilograms.  2 x 270 is 540.  But half of that was left by T Rex, which means there was initially 540 + 540 = 1080 kilograms.  The answer is 1080. 
 The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the small triceratops, so 1/2 of the triceratops was eaten.   Then, after the velociraptors came, they ate half of what was left, which means 1/2 of what the T-Rex didn't eat, or 1/4 of the whole triceratops.   
Then, the Allosaurus ate what was left, which was 1/4 of what the Tyrannosaurus rex didn't eat, or 1/4 of the triceratops minus 1/2 of the triceratops, which is 1/4.   
So, if the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, we can set up the equation 1/4 = 270 to solve for the amount of the triceratops.  Multiply both sides by 4 to get 1 = 4 * 270, which gives us 1080.  The answer is 1080.

[EXP] 158: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  The biggest waterslide is 300 feet long.  If people slide down at 60 feet/minute, they will take 300/60 = 5 minutes to slide down.  The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long.  If people slide down at 80 feet/minute, they will take 240/80 = 3 minutes to slide down.  The difference is 5 - 3 = 2 minutes.  The answer is 2. 
300 ft / 60 ft/min = 5 minutes for the biggest water slide.  And 240 ft / 80 ft/min = 3 minutes for the second biggest slide.  So it takes 5 - 3 = 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide.  The answer is 2. 
 The biggest slide is 300 feet long, and people slide down at 60 feet/minute.  So the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide is 300 / 60 = 5 minutes. 

The second biggest slide is 240 feet long, and people slide down at 80 feet/minute.  So the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide is 240 / 80 = 3 minutes. 

To find the difference in time, subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide.  5 - 3 = 2.  It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.  The answer is 2. 
 Let's calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
= 2 minutes

The answer is 2 minutes. 
300 feet divided by 60 feet per minute is equal to 5 minutes.  240 feet divided by 80 feet per minute is equal to 3 minutes.  The time difference is 5 - 3 minutes.  The answer is 2. 
 We need to find the time it takes to ride each slide.  For the biggest slide, the distance is 300 feet and the speed is 60 feet/minute.  To find the time, we divide the distance by the speed.  300 / 60 = 5 minutes.  For the second slide, the distance is 240 feet and the speed is 80 feet/minute.  240 / 80 = 3 minutes.  The question asks how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide, so we subtract the time for the second slide from the time for the biggest slide.  5 - 3 = 2.  The answer is 2 minutes. 
300 - 240 is 60.  To slide down the 300 ft slide takes 300 / 60 = 5 minutes.  To slide down the 240 ft slide takes 240 / 80 = 3 minutes.  So, it takes 5 - 3 = 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.  The answer is 2. 
 Let's find the time it takes to ride each slide. 

For the first slide, distance = 300 feet, speed = 60 feet/minute. 
Time = distance / speed = 300 / 60 = 5 minutes. 

For the second slide, distance = 240 feet, speed = 80 feet/minute. 
Time = distance / speed = 240 / 80 = 3 minutes. 

To find the difference in time: 5 minutes (for the first slide) - 3 minutes (for the second slide) = 2 minutes. 
The answer is 2. 
 The first slide is 300 ft long.  The person slides at a rate of 60 ft/minute.  So it will take 300 / 60 = 5 minutes to complete the slide. 

The second slide is 240 ft long.  The person slides at a rate of 80 ft/minute.  So it will take 240 / 80 = 3 minutes to complete the slide. 

The difference is 5 - 3 = 2 minutes.  The answer is 2. 
 The biggest waterslide is 300 feet long, and they go 60 feet per minute.  So it will take 300 / 60 = 5 minutes to slide down the slide. 

The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long, and they go 80 feet per minute.  So it will take 240 / 80 = 3 minutes to slide down the slide. 

To find how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide, we have to subtract 3 from 5.  5 - 3 is 2.  The answer is 2. 
1st, we calculate how long it takes to slide down the 1st waterslide: the length of the slide is 300 feet, and we slide down at 60 feet/minute.  So the time it takes is 300 / 60 = 5 minutes. 

2nd, we calculate how long it takes to slide down the 2nd waterslide: the length of the slide is 240 feet, and we slide down at 80 feet/minute.  So the time it takes is 240 / 80 = 3 minutes. 

3rd, we subtract the time it takes to slide down the 2nd slide from the time it takes to slide down the 1st slide: 5 - 3 = 2.  The answer is 2 minutes. 
 For the first gigantic slide, it will take 300 / 60 = 5 minutes to slide down.  For the second slide, it will take 240 / 80 = 3 minutes to slide down.  The difference in the time it takes is 5 - 3 = 2 minutes.  The answer is 2. 
 The bigger slide is 300 feet long.  People slide down at 60 feet per minute.  To slide down the full 300 feet, it will take 300 / 60 = 5 minutes.  

The smaller slide is 240 feet long.  People slide down at 80 feet per minute.  To slide down the full 240 feet, it will take 240 / 80 = 3 minutes. 

 To find out how long longer it takes to ride the bigger slide, subtract the time it takes to ride the smaller slide from the time it takes to ride the bigger slide.  5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.  The answer is 2 minutes. 
300 feet for the biggest waterslide, and 60 feet per minute.  300 / 60 = 5.  It will take 5 minutes to ride the biggest slide. 
For the second biggest slide, it's 240 feet, and 80 feet per minute.  240 / 80 = 3.  It will take 3 minutes to ride the second biggest slide. 
To find out how much longer it takes for the biggest slide, subtract the second slide: 5 - 3 = 2.  It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide.  The answer is 2. 
 To find the time it takes to ride each waterslide, you need to find the total length of the slide and divide it by the speed.  For the biggest slide, the total distance is 300 feet and the speed is 60 feet per minute, so the time is 300/60 = 5 minutes.  For the second biggest slide, the total distance is 240 feet and the speed is 80 feet per minute, so the time is 240/80 = 3 minutes. 

To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, you need to subtract the two times.  5 - 3 = 2.  The answer is 2. 
 The biggest water slide is 300 feet long.  We need to find out how long it takes to slide down the biggest slide.  The person slides at 60 feet per minute.  So it will take 300 / 60 = 5 minutes to slide down the biggest slide.  

The second biggest slide is 240 feet long.  We need to find out how long it takes to slide down the second biggest slide.  The person slides at 80 feet per minute.  So it will take 240 / 80 = 3 minutes to slide down the second biggest slide. 

We need to find the difference in the time taken to ride the two slides.  The difference is 5 - 3 = 2.  The answer is 2. 
 Let's start by finding out how long it takes to ride the biggest slide.  If the slide is 300 feet long and you're going down at a rate of 60 feet per minute, then you'll take 300/60 = 5 minutes to complete the ride. 

For the second biggest slide, you'll go at a rate of 80 feet per minute.  The slide is 240 feet long, so you'll take 240/80 = 3 minutes to complete the ride. 

To find the difference, subtract the time it takes on the second slide from the time it takes on the first slide.  5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.  The answer is 2 minutes. 
 We need to find the time it takes to ride each slide, and then subtract the time of the second slide from the time of the first slide.  

First, let's find the time to ride the first slide, which is 300 feet long and people slide down at 60 feet/minute.  

We need to divide the length of the slide by the speed: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes. 

Next, let's find the time to ride the second slide, which is 240 feet long and people slide down at 80 feet/minute.  

We need to divide the length of the slide by the speed: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes. 

Finally, we need to subtract the time of the second slide from the time of the first slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes. 

The answer is 2 minutes.  It takes 2 minutes more to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide. 
 We will solve this problem in 2 steps. 

Step 1: Calculate how long it takes to ride the biggest slide:
The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.  The speed at which people slide down is 60 feet per minute.  To ride the slide, it will take 300/60 minutes. 
300/60 = 5 minutes. 

Step 2: Calculate how long it takes to ride the second biggest slide:
The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.  The speed at which people slide down is 80 feet per minute.  To ride the slide, it will take 240/80 minutes. 
240/80 = 3 minutes. 

To find the difference in time, subtract the time it takes to ride the second slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
5 minutes (biggest slide) - 3 minutes (second biggest slide) = 2 minutes. 
The answer is 2. 
 Let's first find the total time it takes to slide down each slide. 

For the biggest slide, the distance is 300 feet and the speed is 60 feet/minute.  So, the time taken to slide down is 300 / 60 = 5 minutes. 

For the second biggest slide, the distance is 240 feet and the speed is 80 feet/minute.  So, the time taken to slide down is 240 / 80 = 3 minutes. 

Now, we need to compare the times taken to slide down both slides.  We know that the time taken for the bigger slide is 5 minutes, and for the second biggest slide is 3 minutes.  We want to find the difference between these two times. 

So, the difference is 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.  It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.  The answer is 2.

 John drives round trip each time, so he drives 2 * 2 = 4 times a month.  For each trip, the distance driven is 2 * (70 mph) = 140 miles.  So, the total distance driven is 4 * 140 = 560 miles.  The answer is 560. 
 John visits his parents twice a month.  That means he drives there and back twice a month, or 4 times.  Since it takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph, each trip is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles.  Since he does this 4 times a month, he drives 140 miles * 4 = 560 miles per month.  The answer is 560. 
 It takes John 2 hours to drive to his parents' place.   This is a round trip, so he spends 2 hours going there and 2 hours coming back.   That is 4 hours in total.   At a speed of 70 mph, this is a distance of 70 * 4 = 280 miles.   If he does this twice a month, that is 280 * 2 = 560 miles a month.   The answer is 560. 
 John visits his parents twice a month.  For each visit, he makes a round trip.  The distance of the one way trip is 2 x 70 = 140 miles.  Since he makes a round trip, the distance is 2 x 140 = 280.  He makes this trip 2 times a month, so the total distance is 280 x 2 = 560 miles.  The answer is 560. 
 This problem requires us to calculate the distance for one trip, and then multiply by 2 for the round trip, then multiply by 2 for the visits per month. 

The distance for one trip is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Distance = Time * Speed
Distance = 2 hours * 70 mph
Distance = 140 miles

For the round trip:
Distance = 140 miles * 2
Distance = 280 miles

For the visits per month:
Distance = 280 miles * 2
Distance = 560 miles

The answer is 560 miles. 
 According to the problem, it takes John 2 hours to drive to his parents' place, which means the distance is 2 x 70 = 140 miles.  This is a round trip, so add the distance back and forth, which is 140 + 140 = 280 miles.  John visits twice a month, so the total distance is 280 * 2 = 560.  The answer is 560 miles. 
 Round trip means that he drives twice the distance as the one way.  So, it takes him 2 hours to drive one way, and 2 x 2 = 4 hours for the round trip.  The distance of the round trip is 70mph x 4 hours = 280 miles.  Since he visits his parents twice a month, the total distance he drives is 280 miles x 2 = 560 miles.  The answer is 560. 
 John visits his parents twice a month.   A round trip is 2 * 2 = 4 trips.   Each trip is 2 hours long (one hour each way), so his daily trip distance is 2 * 70 = 140 miles.   Since he does this 4 times a month, his total month distance is 140 * 4 = 560 miles.   The answer is 560. 
 John visits 2 times a month.  To drive to his parents' place is a round trip, so it's 2 times the distance.  So he makes a total of 2 * 2 = 4 trips.  It takes him 2 hours each trip, so in total he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours driving.  At a speed of 70 mph, 2 hours is 2 x 70 = 140 miles.  So in total, he drives 4 * 140 = 560 miles a month.  The answer is 560. 
 Let's break down the problem step by step!

* John makes one trip to visit his parents, which is a round trip.  So, the distance he needs to cover is twice the initial distance. 
* The initial distance is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles (since speed = distance/time). 
* Therefore, the total distance for one trip is 2 * 140 = 280 miles. 
* John visits his parents twice a month.  So, the total distance per month would be 2 * 280 = 560 miles. 
* The answer is 560 miles. 
 John has to make a round trip to visit his parents, which means he has to go there and come back.  It takes him 2 hours to drive there, and the same amount of time to drive back.  So in total, he spends 2 + 2 = 4 hours driving there and back.  He has to do this twice a month.  So in total, he spends 4 hours * 2 = 8 hours per month driving there and back. 

To find the distance, we need to know John's speed, which is 70 mph.  We can multiply his speed by his total time, which is 8 hours:

70 mph * 8 hours = 560 miles

He drives 560 miles per month.  The answer is 560. 
 There are 30 days in a month.  John visits his parents twice a month.  John travels to his parents and back.  That is a round trip.  

To get the time to travel to his parents, 2 hours for going and 2 hours for coming back, in total 4 hours.  

The distance at 70 mph speed will be 70 * 4 = 280 miles.  

John visits his parents 2 times, so the total distance for the month will be 280 * 2 = 560 miles.  

The answer is 560. 
 John drives a round trip twice a month.  So he drives a total of 2 trips a month.  The distance for one trip is the distance to his parents and the distance back.  So the distance of one trip is 2 x 70 miles, which is 140 miles.  If he takes 2 hours to drive 70 miles, he drives at 70/2 = 35 miles per hour.  So it will take him 140/35 hours, which is 4 hours to drive 140 miles.  This is for one trip, and he does 2 trips a month.  So he travels 4 hours x 2 trips = 8 hours a month.  He goes 70 miles per hour, so in 8 hours, he travels 70 x 8 = 560 miles a month.  The answer is 560. 
 We need to figure out how many miles John drives from his house to his parents' house, and then multiply that by 2, since this is a round trip. 

Let's break it down:
- John takes 2 hours to drive there from home. 
- The speed is 70 mph. 
- To find the distance, we can multiply the speed (70 mph) by the time (2 hours): 70 x 2 = 140 miles. 
- But this is only the one way, so we need to multiply by 2: 140 x 2 = 280 miles. 

John drives 280 miles per trip, and he visits his parents 2 times a month.  To find out how many miles per month, we multiply the distance per trip by the number of trips: 280 * 2 = 560. 

So the answer is 560.

 Jane started with 0 dollars.  Then she saved 4 dollars per week for 8 weeks.  4 x 8 = 32.  Jane has 32 dollars.  She needs to save $60, so she needs 60 - 32 = 28 more dollars.  

If she saves 4 dollars per week, it will take her 28 / 4 = 7 more weeks. 

The answer is 7. 
 Jane started with 0 dollars saved.  She has 8 weeks of saving 4 dollars each week, so she has saved 8 x 4 = 32 dollars now.  She needs another 60 - 32 = 28 dollars.  For each week, she saves 4 dollars.  28 / 4 = 7.  So it will take her 7 more weeks to save enough money.  The answer is 7. 
 Jane started with 0 dollars.  Since she saves 4 dollars each week, it will take her 60 / 4 = 15 weeks to save 60 dollars. 

But Jane has already saved dollars for the past 8 weeks.  So she already has 4 * 8 = 32 dollars. 

So, she needs to save 60 - 32 = 28 more dollars.  Since she saves 4 dollars each week, it will take her 28 / 4 = 7 more weeks to save 28 dollars. 

Therefore, the answer is 7. 
 Jane has already saved for 8 weeks.  In each week, she added 4 dollars to her allowance.  So she has 8 x 4 = 32 dollars saved.  She still needs to save 60 - 32 = 28 dollars.  If she continues to save 4 dollars a week, we can find out how many weeks she needs to save more by dividing 28 by 4.  28 ÷ 4 = 7.  The answer is 7. 
 Jane started saving 4 dollars per week from week 1 to week 8.  That is 8 x 4 = 32 dollars.  The goal is to save 60 dollars.  To find out how many more weeks it will take, we need to find the difference between the goal and what she already has.  60 - 32 is 28 dollars.  Each week she saves 4 dollars, so 28 / 4 = 7.  The answer is 7. 
 Jane started with 0 dollars.  For 8 weeks, she saved 4 dollars a week.  So she has 4 * 8 = 32 dollars.  To find out how many more weeks it takes for her to have 60 dollars, we subtract the amount she has now from 60: 60 - 32 = 28.  She must save another 28 dollars.  Now we need to find out how many weeks that will take.  28 / 4 = 7 weeks.  So it will take her 7 more weeks.  The answer is 7. 
 Jane started saving 4 dollars a week.  After 8 weeks, she has saved 4 x 8 = 32 dollars.  She needs to have 60 dollars in total, so she still needs 60 - 32 = 28 dollars.  Let's say she saves for x more weeks.  Then she will have saved 4 x (8 + x) dollars.  This is the equation:

4(8 + x) = 60

Solving for x, we get:

4x + 32 = 60

Subtracting 32 from both sides:

4x = 28

Dividing both sides by 4:

x = 7

So, Jane needs to save for 7 more weeks.  The answer is 7. 
8 weeks ago, Jane started with 0 money.  Then she saved 4 dollars each of the 8 weeks.  So she saved in total 4 * 8 = 32.  Now she has 32 dollars.  The question asks how many more weeks it will take her to have 60 dollars.  We know that 60 - 32 is 28, so she has 28 more dollars to save.  Since she saves 4 dollars each week, it will take her 28 division by 4 = 7 weeks.  The answer is 7.

[EXP] 168: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  First, let's find out how much Rissa has.  She was given 5 * 3 = 15 dollars.  After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, she is left with 4/5 of that amount.  15 * 4/5 = 12.  
So she gave 15 - 12 = 3 dollars to her sister.  
Ronnie was given 5 dollars, and he also gave the same amount, 3 dollars, to his sister.  So he has 5 - 3 = 2 dollars left.  The answer is 2. 
 Ronnie was given $5, so Rissa was given 5 * 3 = 15 dollars.  Let's assume Rissa gave x dollars to her little sister.  After giving x dollars, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, which is 4/5 * 15 = 12.  So the amount Rissa gave away is 15 - 12 = 3 dollars. 

Since both Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount, Ronnie also gave away 3 dollars.  Ronnie originally had 5 dollars, so now he has 5 - 3 = 2 dollars left.  The answer is 2. 
 Ronnie was given $5.  Rissa was given 3 times more, so she had 3 x 5 = $15.  After each giving an equal amount to their little sister, Rissa had 4/5 * 15 = 12.  This means she gave 15 - 12 = 3 dollars.  Since Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount, Ronnie must have given 3 dollars also.  Ronnie started with 5 dollars.  After giving 3, he had 5 - 3 = 2 dollars left.  The answer is 2. 
 Rissa was given 5 dollars times 3, so she got 5 * 3 = 15 dollars.  Then after giving the same amount to her little sister, she had 4/5 of 15 dollars left.  So she gave 1/5 of 15 dollars to her little sister, or 15 * 1/5 = 3 dollars.  So Rissa gave 3 dollars to her little sister.  Ronnie gave the same amount, 3 dollars, to her little sister.  So Ronnie now has 5 - 3 dollars left.  5 - 3 is 2.  The answer is 2. 
 Ronnie was given 5 dollars.  Rissa was given 3 times as much, which is 5 x 3 = 15 dollars.  After each of them gave an equal amount to their little sister, each was left with half of what they had: Ronnie had 5 / 2 = 2. 50 and Rissa had 15 / 2 = 7. 50.  So Rissa has 4/5 of 15, and 4/5 of 15 is 12.  So Rissa gave away 15 - 12 = 3 dollars.  Ronnie gave the same amount, 2. 50 dollars.  So Ronnie has 5 - 2. 50 = 2. 50 dollars left.  The answer is 2. 50. 
 Ronnie was given 5 dollars.  Rissa was given 5 * 3 = 15 dollars.  After each of them gave an equal amount to their little sister, they each had half of what they had originally.  Ronnie still had 5 / 2 = 2. 5 dollars.  Rissa had 15 / 2 = 7. 5 dollars, but she has 4/5 of that left, so she has 7. 5 * 4 / 5 = 6 dollars left.  To find Ronnie's money left after Rissa spends her money, subtract 6 from Ronnie's money.  2. 5 - 6 = -3. 5.  The answer is 2. 5. 
 Ronnie was given 5 dollars and Rissa was given 5 * 3 = 15 dollars, because Rissa got thrice as much as Ronnie.  After giving equal amounts to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so she has 15 * (4/5) = 12 dollars left.  

That means she gave 15 - 12 = 3 dollars to her sister.  Ronnie, who also gave an equal amount to her sister, must have given 3 dollars as well.  Ronnie has 5 - 3 dollars left.  5 - 3 = 2.  The answer is 2. 
 Ronnie was given $5, so Rissa's initial money is 3 times that, which is $15.   After giving some amount to her little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her initial money.  4/5 of 15 is 12.  So Rissa gave some amount away.  She gave away 15 - 12 = 3.  Since Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount to their little sister, Ronnie also gave away 3.  Ronnie started with 5, so he has 5 - 3 = 2 left.  The answer is 2. 
 Ronnie was given $5 initially.  Rissa was given thrice as much, which is 5 * 3 = $15.  After giving an equal amount to their little sister, Rissa had $4/5 left.  So she gave away $15 - (15*$4/5) = $15 - $12 = $3 to her little sister.  She had $15 and now has $12 left. 

So Ronnie gave the same amount to his little sister, which is $3 as well. 

Ronnie had $5 and gave away $3, so he now has $5 - $3 = $2. 

The answer is 2. 
 Ronnie was given $5.  Rissa was given 3 times as much, so Rissa was given 5 x 3 = 15 dollars. 

Since Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money after giving an equal amount to her little sister, then she must have given the same amount as Ronnie, say x.  

In other words, Rissa is left with 15 - x = 4/5 x 15.  Solving for x, 15 - x = 12, so x = 3. 

Ronnie gave 3 dollars to his sister, so he is left with 5 - 3 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2. 
 Ronnie was given $5.  Rissa was given thrice as much, which is 3 times 5 = 15.  In total, they had 5 + 15 = 20 dollars.  Now, they gave each of them to their little sister.  So they gave 5 + 15 / 2 = 10 dollars in total.  So Rissa had 15 - 10 = 5 dollars left.  This is 4/5 of her original amount, so her original amount was 5 / 4 * 5 = 6. 25.  Since Ronnie gave the same amount as Rissa, she also gave 2. 5.  So Ronnie has 5 - 2. 5 = 2. 5 dollars left.  The answer is 2. 5 dollars. 
 Ronnie was given $5.  Rissa was given 3 times as much as Ronnie, so she was given 3 * 5 = $15.  After each of them gave their little sister the same amount of money, we should subtract the same amount from both Ronnie's and Rissa's money.  So we subtract the same amount: 5 - ? = Ronnie's new amount, and 15 - ? = Rissa's new amount.  Since Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, Rissa gave away the remaining 5/5 - 4/5 = 1/5 of her money, which is 15 * 1/5 = 3.  So she gave away 3 dollars.  Ronnie and Rissa gave away the same amount of money, so Ronnie also gave away 3 dollars.  Originally Ronnie had 5 dollars, so now she has 5 - 3 dollars left.  5 - 3 is 2.  The answer is 2. 
 Ronnie received 5 dollars.   Rissa received 3 times more, which is 5 x 3 = 15 dollars. 

After giving an equal amount to their little sister, let's say Ronnie gave s dollars.  Then Rissa gave s dollars as well.  Ronnie is left with 5 - s dollars.  Rissa is left with 4/5 of 15, which is 4/5 * 15 = 12 dollars.  Since they gave the same amount, Ronnie gave Rissa s dollars, so: 

12 = 15 - s
12 + s = 15
s = 3

So Ronnie gave 3 dollars to their little sister.  Originally, Ronnie had 5 dollars, and they gave 3 dollars away, so Ronnie is left with: 
5 - 3 = 2

The answer is 2. 
 Ronnie and Rissa started with an equal amount of money.  Rissa got thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa had 3 times what Ronnie had.  Ronnie had 5 dollars, so Rissa had 3 * 5 = 15 dollars.  After giving an equal amount to their little sister, Ronnie and Rissa each gave half their money, so each gave 2. 5 dollars (half of 5 and half of 15).  15 - 2. 5 = 12. 5 dollars left for Rissa.  Rissa was left with 4/5 of her original money, so she should have had 4/5 * 15 = 12 dollars.  But we know she has 12. 5 dollars, so Ronnie must have given a little more than half his money to their sister.  2. 5 + more than half of 5 = 12. 5.  Half of 5 is 2. 5, so Ronnie gave 2. 5 + 2. 5 = 5 dollars.  Ronnie is left with 5 - 2. 5 = 2. 5 dollars.  The answer is 2. 5. 
 Ronnie started with 5 dollars.  Rissa received thrice as much, which is 3 x 5 = 15 dollars.  After both gave some money to their little sister, they still have 4/5 and an unknown amount.  Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, which is 4/5 * 15 = 12.  Since they gave the same amount to their little sister, Ronnie must have given the same amount as Rissa.  When they gave an equal amount, Rissa would have 15 - (the amount they gave) = 12 dollars left.  So the amount they gave each is 15 - 12 = 3 dollars.  Since both gave the same amount, Ronnie and Rissa gave 3 dollars each to their little sister. 

Since Ronnie started with 5 dollars and gave 3 dollars, he has 5 - 3 = 2 dollars left.  The answer is 2. 
 Ronnie was given 5 dollars.   Rissa was given 3 * 5 = 15 dollars.   After each of them gave the same amount to their little sister, Ronnie would be the one giving less because Rissa had more to start with.  So Ronnie gave away an amount, whatever it is, and had the rest.  Let's call that amount R, then Ronnie would have 5 - R dollars left.   Rissa gave away some amount, and is left with 4/5 of 15, which is 15 * 4/5 = 12.  So after Rissa gave away some amount, she was left with 12 dollars.  This means Rissa gave away 15 - 12 = 3 dollars.  Since Rissa gave away the same amount as Ronnie, Ronnie also gave away 3 dollars.  So Ronnie started with 5 dollars and gave away 3, leaving him with 5 - 3 = 2.  The answer is 2.

So he has 1 in his hand and 5 in his pocket, and all 6 new apples, for a total of 1 + 5 + 6 = 12.  He put that in his pocket, so he has 5 + 6 = 11 apples in his pocket.  The answer is 11. 
 This problem is a bit more complex, but we'll break it down step by step. 

Let's start with the number of apples.  Two apples fell out of the tree initially, and one of them landed on Newton's head.  So, we have 1 apple on Newton's head and 1 apple on the ground.  Then, Newton picked up both apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other into the tree.  This causes 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.  Now, we have 1 apple on Newton's head, 1 apple in his pocket, and 5 new apples on the ground.  

Newton picked up the 5 new apples and put all but one in his pocket.  So, he has 1 apple on Newton's hand and the rest in his pocket.  This means he has 5 - 1 = 4 apples in his pocket, plus the 1 apple on his hand.  

Now, he threw the remaining 1 apple at the tree, which causes 6 more apples to fall out of the tree.  We now have 1 apple on Newton's hand, 4 apples in his pocket, and 6 new apples on the ground.  

Newton picked up all the remaining apples and went home.  This means he took the 1 apple on his hand, the 4 apples in his pocket, and the 6 new apples he picked up.  So, he brought home a total of 1 + 4 + 6 = 11 apples.  The answer is 11.

 John buys 10 bottles of scotch and spends $600 on them.  For scotch, the cost per bottle is $600 / 10 = $60.   He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, or 10 x 2 = 20 bottles.  The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than $60, which is 1. 5 x $60 = $90.  The total cost of cognac is 20 x $90 = $1800.  In total, John spends $600 on scotch and $1800 on cognac, which is $2400.  The answer is 2400. 
 We start by finding the cost per scotch bottle.  600 / 10 is 60.  So scotch costs 60 dollars per bottle.  Since John bought twice as many cognac as scotch, that's 20 bottles.  Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than scotch, which is 90 dollars.  So he spent 90 * 20 = 1800 dollars on cognac.  In total, he spent 600 + 1800 = 2400 dollars.  The answer is 2400. 
 John bought 10 bottles of scotch for $600.  Each bottle of scotch costs 600 / 10 = 60 dollars.  He bought twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so 10 x 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.  Each bottle of cognac is 50% more expensive than scotch, so it is 1. 5 times the price of scotch.  1. 5 x 60 = 90.  So, the total cost of 20 bottles of cognac is 20 x 90 = 1800 dollars.  John spent a total of 600 dollars on scotch and 1800 dollars on cognac, so he spent 600 + 1800 = 2400 dollars on everything.  The answer is 2400. 
10 bottles of scotch for $600 means each bottle is $60.  He then buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which means 2 * 10 = 20 bottles.  Each cognac bottle costs 50% more than the scotch, so it costs 60 + 30 = 90 each.  So he spends 20 x 90 = 1800 on cognac.  In total, he spends $600 + $1800 = $2400.  The answer is 2400. 
 John spent 600 dollars on 10 bottles of scotch.  So each bottle of scotch cost 600 / 10 = 60.  He buys twice as many bottles of cognac.  So the number of bottles of cognac is 2 x 10 = 20.  The bottle of cognac costs 50% more than the bottle of scotch.  So each bottle of cognac costs 60 x 1. 5 = 90.  John spent 90 x 20 = 1800 dollars on cognac.  Since he spent 600 dollars on scotch, the total is 1800 + 600 = 2400.  The answer is 2400. 
 Since John buys 10 bottles of scotch for 600 dollars, each scotch bottle costs 600 / 10 = 60 dollars.  

John buys twice as many cognac bottles as scotch bottles.  Since there are 10 scotch bottles, he buys 10 x 2 = 20 cognac bottles.  

The scotch bottles cost 60 dollars each and the cognac bottles cost 50% more, so the cognac bottles cost 60 x (1 + 0. 5) = 90 dollars each.  

John spent 10 x 60 dollars on scotch and 20 x 90 dollars on cognac.  10 x 60 is 600 and 20 x 90 is 1800.  600 + 1800 is 2400.  The answer is 2400. 
 Let's start by finding out how much he spent on scotch.  He bought 10 bottles for $600, so each bottle costs $600/10 = $60.  If he bought twice as many bottles of cognac, then he bought 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.  The price of each cognac is 50% more than the price of scotch, so the price of each cognac is $60 * 1. 5 = $90.  For 20 bottles of cognac, the total cost is 20 * $90 = $1800. 

Now, let's add the cost of scotch and cognac to find the total amount he spent:

$600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400

The answer is 2400. 
 John bought 10 scotch bottles for $600.  This means the cost per bottle is $600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle.  Since he buys twice as many bottles of cognac, he bought 2 x 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.  The cost of cognac bottles is $60 + 50% = $90, so $90 per bottle.  The total cost for 20 bottles of cognac is 20 x $90 = $1800.  The total cost for everything is $600 for scotch + $1800 for cognac = $2400.  The answer is 2400. 
 John buys 10 bottles of scotch for 600 dollars.  600 / 10 = 60, so each bottle of scotch costs 60 dollars.  Then he buys twice as many bottles of cognac that cost 50% more per bottle.  So the cognac bottle price is 50% more than 60 dollars.  50% more is 1. 5 times the price.  1. 5 * 60 = 90 dollars per bottle of cognac.  He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.  The cost of the cognac is 90 * 20 = 1800 dollars.  The total cost of scotch and cognac is 600 + 1800 = 2400 dollars.  The answer is 2400. 
 First, John bought 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.  The cost per bottle of scotch is 600 / 10 = 60 dollars.  Now, he bought twice as many bottles of cognac, which means 10 x 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.  They cost 50% more, which means the same as 1. 5 times the cost of scotch.  So that is 60 * 1. 5 = 90 dollars per bottle of cognac.  20 bottles of cognac will then cost 90 * 20 = 1800 dollars.  In total, John spent 600 + 1800 = 2400 dollars.  The answer is 2400. 
 John buys 10 bottles of scotch for 600 dollars.  So each bottle costs 600 / 10 = 60.  Cognac costs 50% more than 60, so it costs 1. 50 * 60 = 90.  Twice as many bottles of cognac means 10 * 2 = 20 bottles.  20 bottles at 90 dollars each is 90 * 20 = 1800 dollars.  Scuchs is 600 dollars.  Together it is 1800 + 600 = 2400 dollars.  The answer is 2400. 
10 bottles of scotch for $600 is $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.  Therefore, the cognac would be 60 + (50% of 60) = 60 + 30 = $90.  He buys twice as many, so that means 20 bottles of cognac for $90 each, which is 20 x 90 = 1800.  He spends a total of $1800 on scotch and $600 on scotch, so the total cost is 1800 + 600 = 2400.  The answer is 2400. 
 First, John buys 10 bottles of scotch for 600 dollars.  600 divided by 10 is 60.  So 1 bottle of scotch is 60 dollars.  Then, he buys twice as many bottles of cognac at a cost of 50% more per bottle.  50% of 60 dollars is 30.  So cognac is 30 dollars more than scotch, which is 90 dollars per bottle.  He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so that's 20 more bottles.  20 x 90 is 1800.  So the total cost for cognac is 1800 dollars.  John spends 600 dollars on scotch and 1800 dollars on cognac.  600 + 1800 is 2400.  The answer is 2400. 
 John spent $600 on scotch.  It took 10 bottles to do that.  Since each bottle costs 600 / 10 = 60 dollars, the cost per bottle of scotch is $60.  He also buys twice as many (10 x 2 = 20) bottles of cognac.  Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than $60.  50% of $60 is 30.  So cognac costs $90 per bottle ($60 + $30).  20 bottles of cognac cost 20 x 90 = 1800 dollars.  So in total, John spent 600 + 1800 dollars on everything.  600 + 1800 is 2400.  The answer is 2400.

We need to know how many mL of medicine would be in 8 doses.  To find that out, we multiply the amount of medicine in one dosage by 8.  56 * 8 = 448.  The answer is 448. 
14 mL of the first medicine.  Then 3 times that amount is 14 x 3 = 42 mL.  So in 1 dose, there would be 14 + 42 = 56 mL.  Now, we need to find the total amount of medicine for 8 doses.  8 doses will have 56 mL x 8 = 448 mL.  The answer is 448. 
14 mL of one medicine and 3 times that amount of the second medicine means 3 * 14 = 42 mL of the second medicine.  In total, 14 + 42 = 56 mL of medicine is needed for one dose.  

If we multiply this amount by 8 doses, it will be 56 * 8 = 448.  The answer is 448. 
14 mL of the first medicine is needed.  3 times that amount of the second medicine will be 14 x 3 = 42 mL.  To find the total amount of medicine for one dosage, add the two medicines together.  14 + 42 = 56 mL.  Now, to find the total amount of medicine for 8 doses, multiply the amount per dose by 8.  56 mL/dose x 8 doses = 448 mL.  The answer is 448. 
14 mL of the first medicine must be combined with 3 times that amount.  So, the second medicine is 3 x 14 = 42 mL.  In total, there will be 14 + 42 = 56 mL.  This is for one dosage.  Since we need to know how much medicine would be in 8 doses, we multiply 56 mL by 8.  56 * 8 = 448.  The answer is 448. 
14 mL of the first medicine is being combined with 3 times that amount, so we need to find 14 x 3 mL of the second medicine.  14 x 3 = 42.  So in total, 14 + 42 = 56 mL of medicine is required for one dose.  For 8 doses, we need 8 x 56 = 448 mL of medicine.  The answer is 448. 
14 mL of one medicine.  3 times that amount is 14 x 3 = 42 mL of the second medicine.  So in total, the medicine dosage that Saanvi had to combine is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.  If that is for one dose, then for 8 doses, it will be 8 x 56 = 448.  The answer is 448. 
14 mL is the amount of the first medicine.  The second medicine is 3 times the first, so that is 14 x 3 = 42 mL.  In total that is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.  To find out how much medicine in total will be used for 8 doses, just multiply 56 by 8.  56 x 8 = 448.  The answer is 448. 
14 mL is the amount of the first medicine.  The second medicine is 3 times that amount, so it would be 14 x 3 = 42 mL. 

The total amount of medicine in one dose is 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL. 

We need to calculate how much medicine there would be in 8 doses.  In 1 dose, there is 56 mL.  So, in 8 doses, there would be 8 x 56 mL = 448 mL. 

The answer is 448 mL. 
3 times the amount of the second medicine as the first medicine means that the second medicine is 3 * 14 = 42 mL. 

Then, 14 mL of the first medicine + 42 mL of the second medicine = 14 + 42 = 56 mL. 

So, the amount of medicine in one dosage is 56 mL. 

There are 8 doses.  To find the total amount of medicine, we multiply 56 mL by 8:

56 mL × 8 = 448 mL

The answer is 448. 
14 mL of the first medicine is combined with 3 times that amount of the second medicine.  Three times 14 is 14 x 3 = 42.  So the amount of the second medicine is 42 mL.  Therefore, the total medicine is 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.  Saanvi would need 56 mL of medicine for 1 dose.  So for 8 doses, she would need 8 x 56 = 448 mL of medicine.  The answer is 448. 
14 mL of the first medicine.  Three times that amount is 3 x 14 = 42 mL of the second medicine.  The first and second medicine both appear in the combination.  So 14 + 42 = 56 mL of medicine is in each dosage.  To calculate 8 doses, 56 x 8 = 448.  The answer is 448. 
14 mL of the first medicine is needed.  The second medicine is 3 times that amount so it is 14 * 3 = 42 mL.  To find the amount of medicine in 8 doses, you would use 1 dose * total medicine * 8.  So 1 dose * (14 + 42) * 8 = 8(14 + 42) = 8 * 56 = 448.  The answer is 448. 
3 times that amount means that if the amount of the first medicine is X, the second medicine amount is 3X.  So, for the second medicine, the amount is 14 x 3 = 42.  14 mL of the first medicine and 42 mL of the second medicine means a total of 14 + 42 = 56 mL for one dosage.  If we need to combine this for 8 doses, we would multiply 56 mL by 8, which is 56 * 8 = 448 mL.  The answer is 448. 
14 mL of medicine is required for one dosage.  For the second medicine, we are told 3 times that much is needed.  Since 14 mL is required for the first medicine, 3 times 14 is 14 x 3 = 42 mL of the second medicine is required.  

For one dosage, total medicine is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.  

For 8 doses, the total amount of medicine needed is 8 x 56 = 448 mL. 


The answer is 448. 
14 mL of one medicine.  3 times that amount means 14 x 3 = 42 mL of the second medicine.  So in total, there is 14 + 42 = 56 mL of medicine.  Now, let's find out how much medicine in 8 doses.  Each dose is 56 / 1 (since we have 1 foi at the start) = 56 mL.  So in 8 doses, there would be 8 x 56 mL.  This is 448 mL.  The answer is 448. 
1st step: Convert 3 times that amount into a numerical value.  That's 3 x 14 = 42.  
2nd step: Compose the dosage for one dose: 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL. 
3rd step: The number of mL of medicine will be 56 mL in 1 dose.  Since we need to address 8 doses, multiply 56 mL by 8.  56 x 8 = 448 mL.  The answer is 448.

[EXP] 176: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say Carly makes x cupcakes.  We are told that she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.  So, the number of brownies she makes is 3x - 2. 

Each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class.  Therefore, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10. 

We know that the total number of treats is equal to the total number of cupcakes plus the total number of brownies.  We can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4x = 12

Divide by 4:

x = 3

So Carly made 3 cupcakes.  The answer is 3. 
 We need to first find out how many brownies Carly made.  Let's call the number of cupcakes she made x.  Then, the number of brownies she made is 2 less than three times x, which is 3x - 2.  Since each person gets two treats, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.  The total number of cupcakes and brownies is x + 3x - 2 = 4x - 2.  This should be equal to 10.  So, we set up the equation: 4x - 2 = 10.  We can add 2 to both sides: 4x = 12.  Then, we can divide both sides by 4: x = 3.  So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.  The answer is 3. 
 Since Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, let's represent the number of cupcakes as "x".  Then, the number of brownies is 3 times that, or 3x, and 2 less than that, so the number of brownies is 3x - 2.  

Since 5 people in the class will get 2 treats each, there will be a total of 5 x 2 = 10 treats given out.  So the total number of cups and brownies combined is 10.  

The number of cups is x, the number of brownies is 3x - 2, so the equation is x + (3x - 2) = 10.  Simplifying this gives us 4x - 2 = 10.  Adding 2 to both sides gives 4x = 12, and dividing both sides by 4 gives x = 3.  

So Carly made 3 cupcakes.  The answer is 3.

 Originally, Eve had 20 pomelos.  Now she has 1/4 of the original amount.  1/4 of 20 is 5.  So she has 5 pomelos left.  She must have given away the rest, which is 20 - 5 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
1/4 of 20 is 5.  That means Eve is left with 5.  Before giving pomelos away, Eve had 20, so she must have given away 20 - 5 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
20 pomelos in total.  1/4 of 20 is 20 ÷ 4 = 5.  If Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount, then she must have given away 20 - 5 = 15 pomelos.  The answer is 15. 
1/4 of the pomelos means 1/4 of 20.  We can find this by multiplying 20 by 1/4: 20 * (1/4) = 5.  So Eve is left with 5 pomelos.  Eve originally had 20, so she gave away 20 - 5 = 15 pomelos.  The answer is 15. 
20 is the original number of pomelos Eve had.  After giving some pomelos away, Eve is left with 1/4 of the original number of pomelos, so 20 / 4 = 5.  This means she has 5 pomelos left.  To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we can subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number: 20 - 5 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
20 pomelos are the original count.  She is left with 1/4 of the original after giving some away.  1/4 of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5.  If she is left with 5, then she must have given away 20 - 5 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
20 pieces of pomelos initially, and 1/4 of that is left.  So, Eve is left with 20/4 = 5 pomelos.  If she had 1/4 of the original pomelos left, that means she gave away the rest, which is 20 - 5 = 15 pomelos.  The answer is 15. 
20 pieces of pomelos are what Eve has initially.  1/4 of that means 1/4 * 20 = 5.  Eve is left with 5 pomelos.  So before that, she gave away 20 - 5 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
20 pieces of pomelos originally.  She gave away until she had 1/4 of that.  To find that, we need to find 25% of 20.  That is 5.  So she gave away 20 - 5 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
 Eve started with 20 pieces of pomelos.  After giving some to her friend, she had 1/4 of the original pomelos.  

To find out how many pomelos she had left, we can multiply the original amount by the fraction: 20 * (1/4) = 20/4 = 5

Eve originally had 20 pomelos and now she has 5 pomelos.  So she gave away 20 - 5 = 15 pomelos. 

The answer is 15. 
20 is 4 times 5.  4 times 5 is 20.  1/4 of 20 is 20/4.  20/4 is 5.  So 1/4 of 20 is 5.  Eve had 5 pomelos at the end.  Eve gave 20 - 5 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
20 is the number of pomelos Eve had initially.  1/4 of 20 = 20 / 4 = 5.  Since Eve has 1/4 of 20 pomelos left, she must have given away the rest.  The difference between the initial amount and the remaining amount is 20 - 5 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
20 is the amount of pomelos Eve had.  She is left with 1/4 of this, so let's divide 20 by 4 to get 5. 

To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we need to subtract 5 from 20.  20 - 5 = 15.  The answer is 15 pomelos. 
 Eve started with 20 pieces of pomelos.  If she is left with 1/4 of the original, that means she is left with 1/4 * 20 = 5 pieces of pomelos.

 Let's break it down step by step. 

First, the cost of an adult ticket is $12.  There are 2 adults (the parents), so they will pay 2 x $12 = $24. 

The cost of a child ticket is $8.  So for the child, they will pay $8. 

In total, they paid $24 (for adults) + $8 (for child) = $32 for the tickets.

 To determine how many dollars the family paid in total, we need to find out how much each person paid and add that up. 

There are 3 people: 2 adults and 1 child.  The cost of an adult ticket is $12, so the cost for 2 adult tickets is 2 x 12 = 24.  The child ticket is $8.  So the total cost of tickets is 24 + 8 = 32. 

The family then buys 2 popcorns for $3 each.  So the cost of popcorns is 2 x 3 = 6. 

The total amount the family paid is the cost of tickets plus the cost of popcorns: 32 + 6 = 38.

The cost for the child ticket is $8.  The cost for the 2 adult tickets is 2 x 12 = 24.  So the total cost for the tickets is $8 + $24 = $32.  2.  Then they buy 2 popcorns for $3 each.  So that would be 2 x 3 = 6 dollars.  3.  In total, they pay $32 for the tickets and $6 for the popcorns.  So they pay $32 + $6 = $38.  The answer is 38. 
 To start, we need to figure out how many tickets the family bought.  We can start from 1 adult, the parent.  Then there is 1 child.  So that's 2 tickets.  So 2 adult tickets at $12 each is 2 x 12 = 24.  1 child ticket for $8 is 8.  For 2 popcorns at $3 each, that's 2 x 3 = 6.  24 + 8 + 6 = 38.  The answer is 38. 
 The first step is to determine how many adult tickets and child tickets they need.  There are 3 people, so 2 adult tickets are needed.  
So, the total cost of the tickets is 2 x 12 = 24 for the adults and 1 x 8 = 8 for the child.  The total cost of the tickets is 24 + 8 = 32. 
Then, 2 popcorns are purchased for $3 each.  So the total cost of popcorns is 2 x 3 = 6.

 Ryan's allowance per week is 6 dollars.  For 3 weeks, his allowance is 6 * 3 = 18 dollars.  He spent 1. 25 dollars on ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, which is 4 * 1. 25 = 5 dollars, and has 18 - 5 = 13 dollars left.  Movie tickets cost 6. 50 dollars each.  We can calculate how many tickets he can buy by dividing 13 by 6. 50, which is 13 / 6. 5 = 2.  The answer is 2. 
 Ryan started with allowance of $6 for each week, and he did his chores for 3 weeks, so he has 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.  He bought ice cream cones at $1. 25 each for himself and 3 friends, so that's 4 people x 1. 25 = 5.  So he spent 5 dollars.  He has 18 - 5 = 13 dollars left.  Now he wants to buy movie tickets that cost $6. 50 each.  13 ÷ 6. 50 = 2.  The answer is 2. 
1st, Ryan had 6 dollars each week.  He did his chores for 3 weeks, so he has 6 x 3 = 18 dollars.  Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, which is 1. 25 dollars * 4 = 5 dollars.  So he has 18 - 5 = 13 dollars left.  Each movie ticket costs 6. 50 dollars.  To calculate how many tickets he can buy, we can divide 13 by 6. 50:

13 ÷ 6. 50 = 2

The answer is 2. 
 Ryan's allowance is $6 each week, and he worked for 3 weeks.  So he has 6 * 3 = 18 dollars.  Ryan then spent $1. 25 * 4 for the ice cream cones, which is 1. 25 * 4 = 5.  So he had 18 - 5 = 13 dollars left.  Then he wants to buy movie tickets for 6. 50 dollars each.  13 dollars / 6. 50 is 2.  The answer is 2. 
 First, we need to find out how much money Ryan has.  He gets $6 allowance each week for 3 weeks.  So he has 6 x 3 = 18 dollars.  Then he bought 4 ice cream cones (1 for himself and 3 for his friends) for $1. 25 each.  That's 4 x 1. 25 = 5 dollars.  So he has 18 - 5 = 13 dollars.  Now he wants to buy movie tickets that cost $6. 50 each.  Before buying tickets, Ryan has 13 dollars.  He can buy 2 movie tickets (2 x 6. 50 = 13).  The answer is 2. 
 Ryan received 6 dollars for each of the 3 weeks, so in total he got 6 x 3 = 18 dollars.  He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at 1. 25 dollars each.  So that is 4 cones at 1. 25 dollars each, or 1. 25 x 4 = 5 dollars.  After buying the ice cream cones, Ryan had 18 - 5 = 13 dollars left.  Now they want to buy movie tickets at 6. 50 dollars each.  We can divide 13 by 6. 50 to find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, but first, we must divide 13 dollars into 100 cents.  13 dollars is 1300 cents.  1300 / 650 is 2.  The answer is 2. 
 Ryan started with 6 dollars per week for each week he did his chores, for 3 weeks.  So he made 6 * 3 = 18 dollars.  Then he spent 4 dollars (1. 25 * 4 = 5, then 5 + 0. 25 = 5. 25, but we can't spend a fraction of a dollar, so we drop the 0. 25 and subtract 5) to buy ice cream cones for himself and his friends.  After buying ice cream, Ryan has 18 - 4 = 14 dollars left.  Each movie ticket costs 6. 50 dollars.  14 / 6. 50 = 2, so Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.  The answer is 2. 
 Ryan has done his chores for 3 weeks, so he got 6 * 3 = 18 dollars allowance.  He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at 1. 25 dollars each, so that's 4 x 1. 25 = 5 dollars.  So he has 18 - 5 = 13 dollars left.  They want to go to the movies and tickets cost 6. 50 each.  If Ryan can buy n movie tickets, then the cost of the tickets will be 6. 5 * n.  This cost plus the amount Ryan has left should equal 13.  6. 5n + 13 = 13.  Solving for n, we get 6. 5n = 0, so n = 0.  But this doesn't make sense because Ryan can't buy 0 movie tickets.  So we try n = 2, which gives 6. 5 * 2 + 13 = 13 + 13 = 26, which is greater than 13.  So Ryan can buy 2 tickets.  The answer is 2.

[EXP] 189: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 230, [output]: 80% off means Mark gets 80% of the original price (400) off.  80% of 400 is 0. 8 x 400 = 320.  So he pays 400 - 320 = 80 dollars for the radiator.  Then he pays the mechanic 3 hours at 50 dollars an hour.  3 x 50 = 150 dollars.  In total, he spent 80 + 150 = 230 dollars.  The answer is 230. 
80% off 400 is 80/100 * 400 = 320.  So Mark will pay 400 - 320 = 80 for the radiator.  He also needs to pay 3 hours * 50 dollars an hour = 150 dollars to the mechanic.  So, in total, Mark pays 80 + 150 dollars.  The answer is 230. 
80% off means the 400 dollar radiator is now 20% of 400, which is 0. 2 * 400 = 80 dollars.  Mark paid 80 dollars for the radiator.  Then he paid 50 dollars an hour and it took 3 hours, so 50 * 3 = 150 dollars for labor.  In total, Mark paid 80 + 150 = 230 dollars.  The answer is 230. 
80% off means 20% of the original price is still needed to be paid.  So Mark needs to pay 20% of 400 dollars.  20% of 400 is 20/100 * 400 = 80 dollars.  So Mark needs to pay 80 dollars for the radiator.  Then, he hires a mechanic for 3 hours at 50 dollars per hour.  3 x 50 is 150 dollars.  So Mark pays 80 + 150 = 230 dollars in total.  The answer is 230. 
80% off means 80% of the original cost is discounted.  To find the discount, multiply the original cost by the discount percentage: 400 x 0. 8 = 320.  So the cost with the discount is 400 - 320 = 80.  The mechanic's work is for 3 hours at $50 per hour, so that's 3 x 50 = 150.  The total cost is 80 + 150 = 230.  The answer is 230. 
80% off means he pays 20% of the original cost, which is 0. 2 * 400 = 80 dollars.  He owes the junk shop 80 dollars.  He also pays 50 dollars for 3 hours of labor.  50 * 3 = 150 dollars.  In total, he pays 80 + 150 = 230 dollars.  The answer is 230. 
1.  Mark buys a new radiator for 400 dollars, but gets 80% off.  To find 80% of 400, multiply 400 * 0. 8 = 320.  So he pays 400 - 320 = 80 dollars for the radiator. 

2.  Then, it takes 3 hours for the mechanic to install the radiator, at 50 dollars an hour.  So Mark pays the mechanic 3 * 50 = 150 dollars. 

3.  In total, Mark pays 80 + 150 = 230 dollars.  The answer is 230. 
1st step: The original cost of the radiator is $400.  If it is 80% off, then it costs 400 * (1 - 0. 8) = 400 * 0. 2 = 80 dollars.  So the cost of the radiator is $80.  Then he hires a mechanic for 3 hours at $50 per hour.  3 * 50 is 150.  80 + 150 is 230.  The answer is 230. 
80% off means 20% of the price remains.  So the price of the radiator after discount is 400 * 0. 2 = 80 dollars.  He pays 80 dollars for the radiator.  Then, it takes 3 hours at $50 per hour to install it.  3 * 50 = 150.  He pays 150 dollars for labor.  Total cost is 80 + 150 = 230 dollars.  The answer is 230. 
80% off means 20% left, which means Mark will pay 20% of the original price, or 0. 20 * 400 = 80.  Then, he hires a mechanic to install it for 3 hours at $50 per hour.  3 * 50 = 150.  To find the total, 80 + 150 = 230.  The answer is 230. 
1.  First, Mark gets the radiator for 80% off.  The original price is $400.  80% off means that he gets a discount of 80/100 x 400 = $320.  So he pays 400 - 320 = $80 for the radiator.  2.  He also pays the mechanic for 3 hours at $50 an hour.  He pays 3 x 50 = $150 for the mechanic.  3.  He pays a total of $80 + $150 = $230.  The answer is 230. 
400 dollars is the original price of the radiator.  80% off means the reduction in price will be 80% of 400, which is 0. 8 x 400 = 320.  So the price of the radiator at the junk shop is 400 - 320 = 80.  The cost of hiring a mechanic for 3 hours at 50 dollars an hour is 3 x 50 = 150 dollars.  The total amount he paid is the cost of the radiator and the cost of hiring the mechanic.  So it is 80 + 150 = 230.  The answer is 230. 
80% off means that Mark only needs to pay 20% of the original cost, which is 400 * 0. 2 = 80.  The cost of the car will be $80.  He also hires a mechanic for 3 hours at $50 an hour.  That's 3 * 50 = $150.  So the total cost is 80 + 150 = 230.  The answer is 230. 
80% off means Mark gets 80% discount, which is 0. 20.  That means he pays 20% of $400.  20% is 0. 20 * 400 = 80.  So the cost of the radiator is 80.  The mechanic takes 3 hours at $50 per hour.  3 * 50 = 150.  In total, Mark pays 80 + 150 = 230.  The answer is 230. 
 The cost of the radiator initially is $400.  Since Mark gets it at 80% off, what he pays is 400 x (1 - 0. 80) = 400 x 0. 20 = 80.  He also pays the mechanic 3 hours at $50 an hour.  That is 3 x 50 = 150.  So his total cost is 80 + 150.  That is 230.  The answer is 230. 
 Mark needs to get a radiator that costs $400.  He gets it at a junk shop for 80% off.  To find the discount, we multiply 400 by the discount.  0. 80 x 400 = 320.  So the discount is 320 and he pays 400 - 320 = 80 dollars.  Then, he hires a mechanic to install it for 3 hours at $50 an hour.  3 x 50 = 150, so he pays the mechanic 150 dollars.  In total, Mark pays 80 + 150 = 230 dollars.  The answer is 230. 
80% off of 400 dollars would be 80% of 400, which is 0. 8 * 400 = 320.  Or, if you want to think about it in a simpler way, what is 400 minus 80% of 400? So, 400 - (0. 8 * 400) = 400 - 320 = 80.   So, Mark pays 80 dollars for the radiator. 

Additionally, the mechanic takes 3 hours at 50 dollars per hour.  3 x 50 is 150.  So, in total, Mark pays 80 + 150 = 230.  The answer is 230.
