The football team played 22 games.  They won 8 more than they lost.  This means that the number of wins plus the number of losses equals 22, and the difference between the number of wins and losses is 8. 

Let's say the number of losses is x.  Then the number of wins is x + 8. 

We can write an equation based on this information: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

So the team lost 7 games. 

The number of wins is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age as:

Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Since Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, we can calculate Mary's age as:

Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

Now we know the ages of the three girls: Jessa is 20, Joan is 25, and Mary is 23.

32 (snails in larger aquarium) - 4 (snails in smaller aquarium) = 28

This means that there is a difference of 28 snails between the two aquariums.  The problem states that this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.  Let's call the number of fish in both aquariums "x".  We can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 ÷ 2
x = 14

This means that there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

[EXP] 83: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 37, [output]:  Let's start by calculating the cost of making 10 sandwiches. 

The cost of bread is $3 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  So the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3. 

The cost of cheese and condiments is $30 for 10 sandwiches.  This means the cost per sandwich is $3 ($30 ÷ 10). 

The total cost per sandwich is the cost of bread plus the cost of cheese and condiments, which is $3 + $3 = $6. 

The price each sandwich is sold for is $7.  To find the profit per sandwich, subtract the cost from the selling price: $7 - $6 = $1. 

The profit per sandwich is $1.  Since they sell 10 sandwiches, the total profit is 10 x $1 = $10. 

The answer is $10.

Adding 10 to both sides:

- There are 3 homes. 
- The first house needs 1/2 of the second. 
- The third house needs double the first. 


Let's assume the second house needs x cases of shingles.  Then the first house needs x/2 and the third house needs 2x. 


We know the total number of cases of shingles needed is 250, so we can set up the equation:


x + x/2 + 2x = 250


Combine like terms:


3x/2 + 2x = 250


Combine like terms:


5x/2 = 250


Multiply both sides by 2:


5x = 500


Divide both sides by 5:


x = 100


So the second house needs 100 cases of shingles.  The first house needs half of that, which is 50 cases of shingles.  The third house needs double the first, which is 2 * 50 = 100 cases of shingles.

[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  Since the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100, we know that their ages add up to 100.  We are given that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so let's say Jean is x years old.  Then, Paul is x + 10 years old. 

We are also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.  Let's call Peter's age y.  Then, the equation for Peter's age is:

y = (x + 10) + x

To solve for y, we can combine like terms:

y = 2x + 10

We know that the combined age of all three is 100, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 10) + y = 100

Substitute the expression for y from above:

x + (x + 10) + (2x + 10) = 100

Combine like terms:

4x + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4x = 80

Divide by 4:

x = 20

So, Jean is 20 years old.  Since Paul is 10 years older than Jean, Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.  Finally, Peter's age is the sum of Paul and Jean's ages:

Peter's age = Paul's age + Jean's age
= 30 + 20
= 50

The answer is 50.

[EXP] 157: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1080, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step! 

Initially, the triceratops has an unknown amount of meat, which we'll call x. 

A Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of it, leaving x/2. 

Then, a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, which is x/4 (since half of x/2 is x/4). 

This means, the amount left is x/2 - x/4 = x/4. 

The last 270 kilograms were left, and a group of Allosaurus gulped that down.  This means the remaining amount was 270 kg. 

So, we set up the equation:
x/4 = 270

To find x, we multiply both sides by 4:
x = 270 * 4
x = 1080

So, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

[EXP] 185: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 34, [output]:  Charisma meditates 15 minutes twice a day.  That's 15 * 2 = 30 minutes a day.  She does this 7 days a week.  So in a week, she spends 30 * 7 = 210 minutes on meditation. 

Charisma also practices yoga 1 hour = 60 minutes, 5 days a week.  That is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes per week. 

In 4 weeks, she would have spent 210 * 4 = 840 minutes on meditation and 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes on yoga.  840 + 1200 = 2040.  The answer is 2040.

[EXP] 186: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Ryan's allowance is 6 dollars per week.  He did his chores for 3 weeks, so he earned 6 x 3 = 18 dollars.  Then he bought 4 ice cream cones ($1. 25 each) which would be 4 x 1. 25 = 5. 00.  So he spent 5 dollars.  He now has 18 - 5 = 13 dollars left.  The tickets cost 6. 50 each, so 13 / 6. 50 = 2, which is the number of movie tickets he can buy.

[EXP] 187: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 72, [output]: 12 unique toys are divided into two halves, which means 6 toys are sold for 5 dollars each and 6 toys are sold for 7 dollars each.  6 toys for 5 dollars each is 6 x 5 = 30 dollars.  6 toys for 7 dollars each is 6 x 7 = 42 dollars.  In total, Matthew would earn 30 + 42 = 72 dollars.

[EXP] 188: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2280, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the amount each person raised:

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750
Alexandra raises $430
Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700
Sarah raises $300.
