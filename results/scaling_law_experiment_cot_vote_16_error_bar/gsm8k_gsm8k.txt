[EXP] 2: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 160, [output]: 40% of 200 GB is 0. 4 x 200 = 80 GB.  So Carla has downloaded 80 GB before the restart.  The restart takes 20 minutes, but 80 GB was downloaded in 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.  So the download speed is only half as fast as normal.  Carla has to restart from the beginning.  The total time will be the same to download 200 - 80 = 120 GB, which is 120 / 2 = 60 minutes.  Total time = 60 + 20 + 40 = 120 minutes.  The answer is 120 minutes. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Carla starts downloading a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute.  The total time it would take to download the file is:
200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

Since she's 40% of the way through the download, or 0. 4 x 200 = 80 GB, she would have already downloaded 80 GB in 80 / 2 = 40 minutes. 
But then Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes.  So, 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes have passed. 
Now, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.  She still has 200 - 80 = 120 GB left to download.  The remaining time is:
120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes Carla to download the file is:
60 minutes (initial download) + 60 minutes (remaining download) = 120 minutes
The answer is 120 minutes. 
200 GB file is being downloaded at a rate of 2 GB/minute.  So the initial download would take 200 / 2 = 100 minutes. 

When Windows forces a restart, 40% of the file has been downloaded, which is 0. 4 x 200 = 80 GB.  Since a file of 80 GB took 80 / 2 = 40 minutes to download, the download was 40 minutes into the process when the restart occurred. 

After the restart, Carla has to start the download again from the beginning.  Since 80 GB has already been downloaded, Carla has to download the remaining 120 GB (200 - 80).  The rest of the file will take 120 / 2 = 60 minutes to download. 

Adding the time taken to download 80 GB and the time taken to download the remaining 120 GB, Carla will take in total 40 minutes + 60 minutes = 100 minutes. 

Since Carla already spent 20 minutes installing updates, the total time it takes Carla to download the file is 100 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes. 

The answer is 120 minutes. 
200 GB file, normally download 2 GB/minute, speed up to 40%, and since 40% of 200 is 80 GB, we need to find out how much time take to download 80 GB, then restart, then continue, and how long it takes. 

First, 80 GB takes 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.  Then, there is a 20 minute restart.  So total time up to this point is 60 minutes.  After this, only 120 GB left (200 - 80 = 120).  It will take 120 / 2 = 60 minutes.  So total time to download 200 GB is 60 + 60 = 120 minutes.  The answer is 120.

[EXP] 3: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]: 20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 20% of 20 = 0. 2 x 20 = 4 students.  The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16.  25% of the remaining students (25% of 16) enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0. 25 x 16 = 4 students.  So the remaining number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 = 12.  The percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 12/20 = 0. 6 = 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 20% x 20 = 4.  The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16.  25% of those remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25% x 16 = 4.  So, 16 - 4 = 12 students are left for hip-hop dance.  To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) x 100 = 60.  The answer is 60. 
20% of 20 students is 20 x 0. 20 = 4 students.  So 20 - 4 = 16 students are remaining.  25% of 16 is 16 x 0. 25 = 4 students.  16 - 4 = 12 students are remaining.  So 12 out of 20 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.  

Percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) x 100 = 60.  The answer is 60. 
20% of the 20 students will be 20% * 20 = 4 students.  Then 25% of the remaining students will be 25% * (20 - 4) = 25% * 16 = 4 students.  The remaining students who enrolled in hip-hop are 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.  To find the percentage, we divide the number of students by the total number of students, and multiply by 100.  12 / 20 * 100 = 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
20% of 20 students is 20% * 20 = 4.  This means 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  Then, there are 20 - 4 = 16 students remaining.  25% of 16 students is 25% * 16 = 4.  This means 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.  The rest, which is 16 - 4 = 12 students, enrolled in hip-hop dance. 

The total number of students in the class who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 12.  There were originally 20 students in the class.  So the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance is 12/20 = 60%. 

The answer is 60%. 
20% of the 20 students are enrolled in contemporary dance.  That is 20 x 20% = 4 students.  20% of the 16 remaining students are enrolled in jazz dance.  That is 16 x 25% = 4 students.  16 - 4 = 12 students are left, which is the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.  To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, divide 12 by 20 and multiply by 100.  12 / 20 = 0. 6.  0. 6 x 100 = 60.  The answer is 60%. 
20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance.  This is 20% of 20 students, which is 0. 20 x 20 = 4 students.  Then, 25% of the remaining 16 students (20 - 4 = 16) enrolled in jazz dance.  This is 0. 25 x 16 = 4 students.  The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance.  There were 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students left.  This is 12 out of 20 students.  To convert the fraction to percent, multiply by 100 to get 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
20% of the students enrolled in contemporary, so 20% of 20 is 4 students.  The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16.  25% of the remaining students, which is 25% of 16, enroll in jazz.  25% of 16 is 4.  The remaining students are 16 - 4 = 12.  So out of the 20 students, 12 students enrolled in hip-hop.  The percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop is 12/20 = 0. 6, which is 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
20 students are in the dance class initially.  20% of them enrolled in contemporary dance.  So 20% of 20 is 0. 2 * 20 = 4.  So 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  That leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students.  25% of 16 enrolled in jazz dance.  0. 25 * 16 = 4.  So 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.  That leaves 16 - 4 = 12 students.  These students enrolled in hip-hop.  So the percentage of 12 out of 20 is 12 / 20 = 0. 6 = 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
20% of 20 students are 20% * 20 = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  Out of the 20 students, 4 are gone.  So there are 20 - 4 = 16 students left.  25% of 16 students are 25% * 16 = 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.  The rest of the students, 16 - 4 = 12, are left for hip-hop dance.  To find the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to divide 12 by the total number of students, 20, and multiply by 100: (12/20) * 100 = 60.  The answer is 60%. 
20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  This is 0. 2 * 20 = 4.  So 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  Now we have 20 - 4 = 16 students remaining. 

25% of the remaining students or 25% of 16 students enrolled in jazz dance.  This is 0. 25 * 16 = 4.  So 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.  Now we have 16 - 4 = 12 students remaining. 

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance, which is 12 students. 

To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide 12 by 20 and multiply by 100.  12 / 20 * 100 = 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
20 students are in the dance class.  20% of them enroll in contemporary dance, which is 20% * 20 = 4 students. 

20 students in class, minus 4 for contemporary dance, leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students.  25% of these 16 students enroll in jazz dance, which is 25% * 16 = 4 students. 

Remaining students in class, after 4 for contemporary and 4 for jazz, are 16 - 4 = 12.  So, 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance. 

The total percentage of students in hip-hop dance is 12/20, which simplifies to 3/5, or 60%.  The answer is 60%. 
20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance.  To find how many students that is, we can multiply 20% by 20 students, which is 20% * 20 = 0. 2 * 20 = 4 students.  

So 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.  

Now, there are 20 - 4 = 16 students remaining.  

25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0. 25 * 16 = 4 students.  

So 4 more students enrolled in jazz dance.  

Now, there are 16 - 4 = 12 students remaining.  

In total, hip-hop has 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.  

We want to find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance.  12 out of 20 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.  So 12/20 = 3/5, which simplifies to 0. 6.  Since 0. 6 is 60%, the answer is 60%.

 Let's break it down step by step. 

We know that Samantha is now 31, and she was born 6 years after Raymond.  So Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old. 

We also know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23.  This means that his son was born when Raymond was 23. 

So, to find out how many years ago was Raymond's son born, we need to subtract his age from the current age when his son was born.  He was 23 at the time of his son's birth, so we need to subtract 23 from 25 to get 2.

15 miles before the end of the trip means that Henry's second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles from the start.  He started with 20 miles already completed, so the distance between the first and second stops is 45 - 20 = 25.  The answer is 25. 
20 miles were covered before his first stop.  His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so the total distance from his first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.  So, the distance between the two stops is 40 - 15 = 25 miles.  The answer is 25 miles.

60 miles is the total distance of the trip.  Since Henry stopped after 20 miles, that means the distance to his first stop is 20 miles.  His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.  From his first stop to the end of the trip, that's 60 - 20 = 40 miles.  Before his second stop, that's 15 miles.  So, between his first and second stops, he traveled 40 - 15 = 25 miles.  The answer is 25. 
1st we find the total distance of the trip.  If Henry first stopped after 20 miles, that means the distance from the start to this stop is 20 miles.  His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, which means the distance from the start to this stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.  Then we find the distance between the two stops by subtracting the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop.  45 - 20 = 25.  The answer is 25.

1.  First, find the total number of units in the building:
There are 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units.  So the total number of units is:
15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units

2.  Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can find the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units by the fraction:
120 units * 3/4 = 90 occupied units

3.  To find the number of unoccupied units, subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
120 units - 90 occupied units = 30 unoccupied units

The answer is 30. 
15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 total units.  3/4 of the building is occupied.  So 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 is unoccupied.  1/4 is 1 out of every 4 units.  So unoccupied units are 1/4 * 120 = 30.  The answer is 30.

So the charge for the second half of the year is 140 - 14 = 126 dollars per month.  For the second half of the year, she paid 6 x 126 = 756 dollars.  In total, she paid 840 + 756 = 1596 dollars.  The answer is 1596. 
140 dollars a month for 6 months (first half of the year) is 140 x 6 = 840 dollars.  Then the price is 10% less each month for the next 6 months.  So the new price is 140 - 14 = 126 dollars.  126 x 6 is 756 dollars.  In total, Aleena paid 840 + 756 = 1596 dollars.  The answer is 1596. 
140 x 6 = 840 (first half of the year)
For the second half of the year, the price is 10% less, so it will be 140 x (100 - 10)/100 = 140 x 90/100 = 126. 
And the total cost for the second half of the year will be 126 x 6 = 756.

 First, we need to know how much David does.  Since Sarah does 4 times as much as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds, then David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.  Since Raymond does half as much as Sarah, then he does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds.  Now we need to find the difference between Raymond's 200 pounds and David's 100 pounds.  200 - 100 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
 Let's break it down:
If Sarah does x pounds of laundry, and David does 1/4 of that, then David does x/4 pounds of laundry. 
Raymond does half as much as Sarah, so he does x/2 pounds of laundry. 

Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.  So, x = 400. 
David does x/4 pounds of laundry, which is 400/4 = 100 pounds. 
Raymond does x/2 pounds of laundry, which is 400/2 = 200 pounds. 

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.  The answer is 100. 
 Let's analyze the information:

* Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. 
* Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. 
* Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. 

So, David does:

400 (Sarah's laundry) ÷ 4 = 100 pounds of laundry

Raymond's laundry is half of Sarah's, which is:

400 pounds ÷ 2 = 200 pounds of laundry

Now, we need to calculate the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David:

Raymond's laundry: 200 pounds
David's laundry: 100 pounds
Difference: 200 - 100 = 100 pounds
Raymond does 100 pounds more laundry than David.

[EXP] 13: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Let's start by saying that the number of games they lost is x.  They won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won is x + 8.  The total number of games they played is 22. 

We can set up an equation: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

So the team lost 7 games.  Since they won 8 more games than they lost, they won 7 + 8 = 15 games.  The answer is 15. 
 Let's say the number of games they lost is x.  They won 8 more than they lost, so they won x + 8. 

The total number of games played is 22, so the number of games they won plus the number of games they lost is equal to 22:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So, they lost 7 games.  Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won:

7 + 8 = 15

The answer is 15. 
 Let's start by using the information that they won 8 more games than they lost.  This means that the number of games they lost is 8 less than the number of games they won. 

Let's say the number of games they won is x.  Then, the number of games they lost is x - 8. 

We know that the total number of games they played is 22, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x - 8 = 22

Add 8 to both sides:

2x = 30

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 15

So the number of games they won is 15.  Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they lost is 15 - 8 = 7. 

The answer is 15. 
 Let's say the football team lost x games.  Then they won 8 more than they lost, so they won x + 8 games. 

The total number of games they played is 22, so the number of games they lost plus the number of games they won equals 22:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So the team lost 7 games.  Then they won 7 + 8 = 15 games. 

The answer is 15. 
 The team played 22 games.  They won 8 more than they lost.  Let's say they lost x games.  Then they won x + 8 games.   The total number of games they played is the sum of the number of games they won and the number of games they lost, so we can write the equation x + (x + 8) = 22.  Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 8 = 22.  Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 14.  Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 7.  So they lost 7 games.  They won 7 + 8 = 15 games.  The answer is 15. 
 If the team won 8 more than they lost, that means the number of wins plus the number of losses is equal to 22.  Let's represent the number of losses as L.  Since the team won 8 more than they lost, the number of wins is L + 8. 

We know that the total number of games is 22, so we can set up the equation:

L + (L + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

L = 7

So the team lost 7 games.  Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won:

7 + 8 = 15

 A football team played 22 games.  They won 8 more than they lost.  Let's assume they lost X games.  Then they won X + 8 games.  The total number of games is 22, so X + X + 8 = 22.  This can be simplified to 2X + 8 = 22.  Now, subtract 8 from both sides to get 2X = 14.  Divide both sides by 2 to get X = 7.  Since they won 8 more than they lost, they must have won X + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 games.  The answer is 15. 
22 games were played in total.  The team won 8 more games than they lost.  If we let x be the number of games they lost, the number of games they won would be x + 8, since they won 8 more.

Since every game is either a win or a loss, the sum of wins and losses is 22.  So, x + (x - 8) = 22.  We can combine like terms: 2x - 8 = 22.  Add 8 to both sides: 2x = 30.  Divide by 2: x = 15.  So the team won 15 games.  The answer is 15. "]

[EXP] 23: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 272, [output]: 3 classes for 1 hour each on 3 days (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays) will be 3 * 3 = 9 hours.  2 classes for 2 hours each on 2 days (Tuesdays and Thursdays) will be 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 hours.  So each week, Kimo attends 9 + 8 = 17 hours.  In a semester, Kimo attends classes for 17 * 16 = 272 hours.  The answer is 272. 
3 classes for 1 hour each, 3 days a week is 3 x 3 = 9 hours per week.  On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes for 2 hours each, which is 4 hours.  2 days a week is 4 x 2 = 8 hours per week.  9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours per week.  In one semester, there are 16 weeks.  So the total hours is 17 hours per week x 16 weeks = 272 hours.  The answer is 272. 
 Let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class each week. 

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 x 1 = 3 hours per day.  On Tuesday and Thursday, he has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 hours per day. 

Total hours per week = 3 hours/day x 3 days + 4 hours/day x 2 days = 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

Since there are 16 weeks in one semester, the total hours Kimo spends in class = 17 hours x 16 weeks = 272 hours

The answer is 272. 
 Kimo has 3 one-hour classes each on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.  That is 3 x 3 = 9 hours.  He also has 2 two-hour classes each on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  That is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 hours.  But since each two-hour class is worth 2 hours, that is the same as 8 hours.  So in total, he has 8 + 9 = 17 hours of class per week.  If he does that for 16 weeks, that is 17 x 16 = 272 hours.  The answer is 272. 
 Let's start by finding the total hours Kimo spends in class per week.  
On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 one-hour classes each, so that's 3 hours of class per day.  Since this is 3 days, Kimo spends 3 x 3 = 9 hours in class each week. 
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 2-hour classes each, so that's 4 hours of class per day.  Since this is 2 days, Kimo spends 4 x 2 = 8 hours in class each week. 
Now, let's add the hours Kimo spends in class each week: 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

 Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.  So in total, Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish. 

Anakin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.  Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.  Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish. 

In total, Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish. 

Now we find the total number of fish caught by both of them.  They caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish in total.  The answer is 32. 
 Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish. 

Let's calculate the number of starfish Locsin caught: 10 (Anakin's starfish) - 5 is 5, so Locsin caught 5 starfish. 

Let's calculate the number of sea horses Locsin caught: 6 (Anakin's sea horses) - 3 is 3, so Locsin caught 3 sea horses. 

Let's calculate the number of clownfish Locsin caught: 3 (Anakin's clownfish) + 2 is 5, so Locsin caught 5 clownfish. 

So, Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish. 

In total, Anakin and Locsin caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish.  The answer is 32. 
 First, we calculate what Locsin caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught 5 fewer, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. 

Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught 3 fewer, which is 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. 

Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught 2 more, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish. 

So Locsin caught 5 starfish, 3 sea horses, and 5 clownfish, which means they caught a total of 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish. 

Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish. 

In total, they caught 13 + 19 = 32 fish.  The answer is 32. 
1st, we will add Anakin's fish.  He caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.  So that is 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish. 

Now we need to figure out how many fish Locsin caught.  Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.  Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.  Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish. 

Locsin caught 5 starfish, 3 sea horses, and 5 clownfish.  So in total Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.

For 5 gallons, they spent 5 * 3 = 15 dollars for lemons.  The answer is 15. ']
[EXP] 27: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 23, [output]:  Let's break this down.  Two years ago, Jan's age was 30 - 2 = 28.  Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age, so 28 / 2 = 14, and Mark's age two years ago was 14 + 5 = 19.  Right now, Mark is 19 + 2 = 21.  Jean is 2 years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23.  The answer is 23. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Mark is 2 years younger than Jean, so we can say Mark's age = Jean's age - 2. 

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.  We need to find Mark's age two years ago and half Jan's age two years ago. 

Jan is currently 30 years old, so two years ago Jan's age = 30 - 2 = 28. 

Half of Jan's age two years ago is 28/2 = 14. 

Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age two years ago, so Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5 = 19. 

So Mark's current age = 19 + 2 = 21. 

Since Mark is 2 years younger than Jean, Jean's current age = 21 + 2 = 23. 

The answer is 23. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 


Jan is 30 years old.  2 years ago, Jan's age would have been 30 - 2 = 28. 


Mark is 2 years younger than Jean.  So 2 years ago, Mark would have been 2 years younger than 2 years ago Jean's age. 


The problem states that 2 years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.  So, 2 years ago Mark's age would have been 5 + 28/2 = 5 + 14 = 19. 


If Mark's age 2 years ago was 19, Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21. 


Since Jean is 2 years older than Mark, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23. 


The answer is 23. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

1.  Jean is 2 years older than Mark. 
2.  Two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
3.  If Jan is 30, then 2 years ago Jan's age was 30 - 2 = 28. 

Now let's convert the statement in step 2 to an equation:

Mark's age 2 years ago - 5 = Half of Jan's age 2 years ago

Substitute Jan's age 2 years ago (28) into the equation:

Mark's age 2 years ago - 5 = 14

Add 5 to both sides:

Mark's age 2 years ago = 19

Mark's current age = Mark's age 2 years ago + 2 = 19 + 2 = 21

Jean is 2 years older than Mark, so Jean's current age = 21 + 2 = 23. 

Jan's current age was given as 30, which is not relevant to our solution, but it's nice to know that we matched the given value. 

The answer is 23.

[EXP] 30: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 31, [output]:  Carl ate 2 slices of cheese per sandwich for 7 days, so that's 2 x 7 = 14 slices.  He ate 3 omelets, and each used 3 (2 + 1) slices of cheese, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 slices.  Finally, he used 8 slices for the macaroni and cheese.  Adding these all up, 14 + 9 + 8 = 31.  The answer is 31. 
 Carl ate a sandwich for lunch each day for 7 days, and used 2 slices of cheese in each sandwich.  So he used 2 x 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch. 

He ate omelets for breakfast 3 days and used 1 more slice per omelet than per sandwich, which is 3 slices per omelet.  3 slices x 3 days = 9 slices. 

He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese using 8 slices.  In total, he used 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.  The answer is 31. 
 letting's break it down:

- For sandwiches he used 2 slices per sandwich and had 7 days of sandwiches.  So that is 2 x 7 = 14 slices. 
- For omelets, he used 1 more slice than for sandwiches, so that is 3 slices per omelet and ate omelets for 3 days.  So that is 3 x 3 = 9 slices. 
- For the macaroni, he used 8 slices. 

In total, Carl used 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices.  The answer is 31. 
 Carl started with 0 slices of cheese (we count the slices he used).  

For lunch, he used 2 slices of cheese per day for 7 days (since there are 7 days in a week).  So he used 2 x 7 = 14 slices. 

For omelets, he used one more slice than in a sandwich, so it's 3 slices per omelet.  He ate omelets for 3 days, so he used 3 x 3 = 9 slices. 

He used 8 slices in the macaroni dish. 

To find the total, add all the slices: 0 + 14 + 9 + 8 = 31.  The answer is 31. 
 Carl started the week with 0 slices of cheese.  On each of 7 days, he used 2 slices of cheese for his sandwich, so that's 7 x 2 = 14 slices.  
On 3 of the 7 days, he also made an omelet.  He used 1 more slice than for the sandwich, so he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices for each omelet.  3 slices x 3 days = 9 more slices.  
He used 8 slices for his macaroni and cheese.  
In total, he used 14 + 9 + 8 slices of cheese.  14 + 9 + 8 is 31.  The answer is 31. 
 Let's first find the number of slices of cheese used for sandwiches.  Carl ate 7 sandwiches (one for each day of the week).  Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese, so 2 x 7 = 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches. 
For breakfast, he made 3 omelets and used 1 more slice per omelet than for a sandwich.  So he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.  3 slices per omelet for 3 omelets is 3 x 3 = 9 slices of cheese for omelets. 
Now, for the macaroni and cheese dish, he used 8 slices. 
Adding it all up, Carl used 14 slices for sandwiches, 9 slices for omelets, and 8 slices for the macaroni and cheese.  14 + 9 + 8 = 31.  The answer is 31. 
 There are a few different steps to this problem. 

1.  Carl ate 2 slices of cheese for each of 7 sandwiches, which is 7 * 2 = 14. 

2.  Carl ate 3 omelets, with one more slice per omelet than sandwich.  So it's 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.  3 omelets with 3 slices each is 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese. 

3.  Carl also used 8 slices of cheese in his dinner macaroni and cheese dish. 

Adding the cheese slices together, Carl used 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.  The answer is 31.

[EXP] 31: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Sara wants a jacket for 30 dollars and 2 pairs of shoes for 20 dollars each.  That is a total of 30 + 20 + 20 = 70 dollars.  She already has 10 dollars.  After babysitting 4 times for 5 dollars each, she will have 10 + 4 * 5 = 30 dollars.  She still needs 70 - 30 = 40 dollars.  At 4 dollars per lawn, she needs to mow the lawn 40 / 4 = 10 times.  The answer is 10. 
 Sara needs 30 + 20 + 20 = 70 dollars for the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.  Sara started with 10 dollars.  After babysitting 4 times and making 5 dollars each time, she made a total of 5 * 4 = 20 dollars.  She now has 10 + 20 = 30 dollars.  To get 70 dollars, she needs 70 - 30 = 40 dollars more.  Mowing the lawn for 4 dollars each time, she needs to mow the lawn 40 / 4 = 10 times more.  The answer is 10. 
1.  Sara wants to buy a $30 jacket and 2 pairs of shoes for $20 each.  The total cost is 30 + 20 + 20 = 70.  She already has 10 dollars.  70 - 10 is 60, so she is short 60 dollars. 

2.  Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns 4 * 5 = 20 dollars. 

3.  This leaves her 60 - 20 = 40 dollars short.  She earns 4 dollars each time she mows the lawn.  She must mow the lawn 40 / 4 = 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. 

The answer is 10. 
1st, we need to find how much money Sara earns from babysitting. 
She got $5 each time she babysits the kids, and she babysits 4 times, so she earned 5 * 4 = 20 dollars. 
Then she earns 4 dollars each time she mows the lawn. 
She already had 10 dollars saved, so she has 10 + 20 = 30 dollars. 
A jacket costs 30 dollars, and 2 pairs of shoes cost 20 * 2 = 40 dollars, so she needs 30 + 40 = 70 dollars total. 
Since she has 30 dollars, she needs 70 - 30 = 40 more dollars. 
Since she earns 4 dollars each time she mows the lawn, she must mow 40 / 4 = 10 times. 
So she must mow the lawn 10 times more before she can afford the jacket and shoes.  The answer is 10. 
1.  The total cost of the items Sara wants are: $30 (jacket) + 2 x $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.  2.  Originally, Sara had $10.  She earns $5 for each of 4 babysitting days, so she now has: $10 + 4 x $5 = $10 + $20 = $30.  3.  Total money she has now: $30.  The cost of shoes and jacket: $70.  She is $70 - $30 = $40 short.  She can earn $4 each time she mows the lawn.  4.  She needs $40 more and earns $4 for each lawn she mows.  So she needs to mow the lawn 40 / 4 = 10 times before having enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.  The answer is 10. 
 Sara had 10 dollars originally.  
She babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, for a total of 5 x 4 = 20 dollars.  
Her parents pay her 4 dollars for mowing the lawn, so every time she mows the lawn, she gets closer to the amount needed.  

Let's just calculate the total amount of money she needs: 
The jacket is 30 dollars and shoes are 2 x 20 = 40 dollars.  
In total, she needs 30 + 40 = 70 dollars.  
She needs to get 70 - 10 = 60 dollars more.  
She has 20 dollars from babysitting.  She only has 60 - 20 = 40 dollars left to make.  
Since each time she mows the lawn, she earns 4 dollars, 4 x ? = 40.  
4x = 40 (divide by 4) 
x = 10

She needs to mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.  The answer is 10.

 Let's find the ages of Mary and Joan.  Since Jessa is 20 years old, Joan is 5 years older, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.  Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.  The sum of their ages is 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.  The answer is 68. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 

Jessa is 20 years old. 

Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old. 

Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old. 

Now, we need to find the sum of their ages:
20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68. 

The answer is 68. 
 Let's break this down step by step.  Jessa is 20 years old. 

Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old. 

Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old. 

Now, let's add up the ages: Jessa is 20, Joan is 25, and Mary is 23.  The sum of the ages is 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.  The answer is 68. 
 Let's start with Jessa being 20 years old.  Since Joan is 5 years older than her, Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.  Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old. 

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68.  The answer is 68. 
 Since Jessa is 20 years old, Joan is 5 years older, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.  
Since Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old. 
To find the sum of their ages, calculate: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.  The answer is 68. 
 Since Jessa is 20 years old, that means Joan is 5 years older, which is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.  Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, which means she is 25 - 2 = 23 years old. 

The sum of the ages of the three girls is:
20 (Jessa's age) + 25 (Joan's age) + 23 (Mary's age) = 68

The answer is 68. 
 We can start by figuring out how old Joan and Mary are.  Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.  Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old. 

To find the sum of the ages, we add up their ages: 20 (Jessa) + 23 (Mary) + 25 (Joan) = 68. 

The answer is 68. 
 Jessie is 20 years old.  Joan is five years older than Jessie, so 20 + 5 = 25 years old.  Mary is two years younger than Joan, so 25 - 2 = 23 years old.  Adding up the ages of the three girls, we have 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.  The answer is 68. 
 Firstly, we must determine the age of Joan and Mary.  Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.  Mary is then two years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

[EXP] 36: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Let's start by finding the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums: 32 - 4 = 28 snails. 

The problem states that the difference between the number of snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.  So, the number of fish is half of the difference: 28 / 2 = 14 fish. 

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, each aquarium has 14 fish.  The answer is 14. 
4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another.  The difference is 32 - 4 = 28.  This is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums.  Let's call the number of fish "x".  Then, 2x = 28, so x = 14. 

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, they each have 14 fish.  The answer is 14. 
 There are 4 snails in the first aquarium and 32 snails in the second aquarium.  So the difference is 32 - 4 = 28.  This difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums.  We can set up an equation:

[EXP] 38: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 168, [output]:  Since Andrea has 52 apples, and she has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.  Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.  Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.  In total, there are 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits.  The answer is 76. 
 Andrea has 52 apples, which is 8 more than Jamal.  So Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.  Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.  So Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.  Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.  Half of 48 is 24.  So Andrea has 24 bananas.  52 apples and 24 bananas are 52 + 24 = 76 fruits.  The answer is 76. 
 Andrea has 52 apples.  Because Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal must have 52 - 8 = 44 apples. 

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas. 

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. 

To find the total number of fruits, we count the apples and bananas: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits. 

The answer is 76. 
 We are given the following information:
- Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. 
- Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. 
- Andrea has 52 apples. 

From the first statement, we know that Jamal's number of apples is 52 - 8 = 44. 

From the second statement, Jamal's number of bananas is 44 + 4 = 48. 

Now, we know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48/2 = 24 bananas. 

Adding the number of apples and bananas of Andrea, we get 52 (apples) + 24 (bananas) = 76.  The answer is 76. 
 We will start by using the information we know about Andrea, that she has 52 apples.  The question states that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so we can set up an equation based on that. 

Andrea's apples - Jamal's apples = 8

52 (Andrea's apples) = Jamal's apples + 8

We can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to get:

52 - 8 = Jamal's apples

Jamal's apples = 44

Since the question states that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can set up another equation based on that. 

Jamal's bananas = Jamal's apples + 4

Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4

Jamal's bananas = 48

Now we know that Jamal has 48 bananas and 44 apples.  The question also states that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can set up an equation based on that. 

Andrea's bananas = Jamal's bananas / 2

Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2

Andrea's bananas = 24

Now we can add the number of apples and bananas to get the total number of fruits. 

Andrea's apples = 52
Andrea's bananas = 24

Total fruits = 52 + 24
Total fruits = 76

[EXP] 39: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 118000, [output]:  Mr.  Tan sold his house for 400,000 dollars.  He paid transfer fees that amount to 3% of the selling price.  

3% of 400,000 = 0. 03 * 400,000 = 12,000. 

He also paid a brokerage fee that is 5% of the selling price. 

5% of 400,000 = 0. 05 * 400,000 = 20,000. 

After paying the fees, he is left with 400,000 - 12,000 - 20,000 = 368,000. 

However, he still needs to pay 250,000 for the remaining loan amount.  

So, his net proceeds from selling the house is 368,000 - 250,000 = 118,000. 

The answer is 118,000. 
 Mr.  Tan sold his house for $400,000.  
The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, which is 3% x 400,000 = 12,000. 
The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 5% x 400,000 = 20,000. 
In total, he paid the transfer fees and brokerage fees of 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000. 
He sold the house for 400,000.  He paid 32,000 in fees.  So his net proceeds are 400,000 - 32,000 = 368,000. 
He also paid 250,000 for the remaining loan amount, so his final net proceeds are 368,000 - 250,000 = 118,000.  The answer is 118,000. 
400 000 is the selling price.  3% of 400 000 is 3/100 * 400 000 = 12 000.  5% of 400 000 is 5/100 * 400 000 = 20 000.  So the transfer fees are 12 000 and brokerage fees are 20 000.  Total fees paid are 12 000 + 20 000 = 32 000.  Now subtract those fees from the selling price: 400 000 - 32 000 = 368 000.  Mr.  Tan also paid 250 000 for the remaining loan.  Subtract that amount: 368 000 - 250 000 = 118 000.  The answer is 118 000. 
3% of the selling price (400 000) is 3/100 x 400 000 = 12 000.  5% of the selling price is 5/100 x 400 000 = 20 000.  Total transfer fees and brokerage fee is 12 000 + 20 000 = 32 000.  Mr.  Tan paid $32 000 for the transfer fees and brokerage fee and $250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house.  Total amount he paid is 32 000 + 250 000 = 282 000.  So, Mr.  Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is the selling price minus the amount he paid.  400 000 - 282 000 = 118 000.  The answer is 118 000. 
 Mr.  Tan sold his house for $400,000. 

First, he paid 3% of the selling price as transfer fees. 

3% of 400,000 is 3/100 x 400,000 = 12,000

Then, he paid 5% of the selling price as a brokerage fee. 

5% of 400,000 is 5/100 x 400,000 = 20,000

So, the total fees paid by Mr.  Tan are 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000

Now, Mr.  Tan has to pay $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. 

So, the total amount Mr.  Tan has to pay is 32,000 + 250,000 = 282,000

Mr.  Tan's net proceeds from selling the house would be the selling price minus the total amount he has to pay. 

Net proceeds = 400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000

The answer is 118,000.

Mr.  Tan still has 400,000 - 32,000 = 368,000 dollars after paying the fees. 

Then, he paid 250,000 for the remaining loan amount, so he has 368,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 left, which is his net proceeds from selling the house.  The answer is 118,000 dollars.

[EXP] 40: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 315, [output]: 1800 is the total number of stitches in the sweater.  We know that the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.  The collar takes 1/10 of that, which is 900 / 10 = 90.  The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 x 90 = 180.  900 (body) + 90 (collar) + 180 (rosette) = 1170.  So the remaining 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches must go to the sleeves.  Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve must take 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.  The answer is 315. 
900 stitches are needed for the body of the sweater.  A tenth of 900 stitches is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.  The collar takes 90 stitches.  The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.  In total, the sweater needs 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.  This leaves 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches left for the sleeves.  So, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.  The answer is 315. 
1800 stitches is the total number of stitches.  900 are for the body.  1/10 of 900 is 90, so the collar takes 90 stitches.  Twice that number is 180, which is the number of stitches for the rosette.  900 + 90 + 180 = 1170, which leaves 630 stitches for the two sleeves.  630 / 2 = 315.  The answer is 315. 
 To start, we know that the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, the collar takes a tenth of that (1/10 * 900 = 90), and the rosette takes twice as many as the collar (2 * 90 = 180).  So the total number of stitches for body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170.  This leaves 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches for the sleeves.  Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 1/2 of the remaining stitches, which is 630 / 2 = 315.  The answer is 315. 
 The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.  The collar takes a tenth of that, which is 900 ÷ 10 = 90 stitches.  The rosette takes twice as many as the collar, so 90 x 2 = 180 stitches.  The total number of stitches is 1800.  So 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches are used.  The two sleeves make up the remaining number of stitches.  1800 - 1170 is 630 stitches.  Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 ÷ 2 = 315 stitches.  The answer is 315. 
 Let's break down the total number of stitches:

2.  The collar takes a tenth of that, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches. 
3.  The rosette takes twice as many as the collar, which is 90 * 2 = 180 stitches. 
4.  The total number of stitches is 1800.  
900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 leaves 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches for the sleeves. 
Each sleeve will take 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.  The answer is 315. 
1800 is the total number of stitches.  The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches it takes to complete the body of the sweater, so the collar takes 900/10 = 90 stitches.  The rosette takes twice as many as the collar, so it takes 2 x 90 = 180 stitches.  So 90 + 180 = 270 stitches for the collar and rosette.  The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, and the collar and rosette take 270, for a total of 900 + 270 = 1170 stitches.  The two sleeves take the remaining 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.  So each sleeve takes half of 630, which is 315.  The answer is 315. 
 Since the sweater is a 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches is 1800.  The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.  The collar takes a tenth of 900, which is 900 / 10 = 90.  The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 90 * 2 = 180.  So far, the body, collar, and rosette take 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

[EXP] 44: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 8, [output]: 1 piece of paper can be folded into 2 pages.  Each folded and unfolded creates 2 pages.  So, 1 piece of paper is used for 2 pages.  For a 32-page tabloid, 32/2 = 16 pieces of paper.  The answer is 16. 
1 piece of paper is used for two pages.  That's because when the paper is folded once, it makes two pages.  Since there are 32 pages in the tabloid, we need to find the number of pairs of pages.  32 / 2 = 16.  So we need 16 pieces of paper to make 32 pages on both sides.  The answer is 16. 
32 pages in a tabloid would mean that 2 pages would be printed on each sheet of paper, because there are 32 pages but the paper would need to have the front and back to hold that many pages.  32 divided by 2 = 16 sheets.  The answer is 16. 
 A single piece of paper can be folded in half to create two sides, and then folded in half again, and so on, creating multiple "pages".

[EXP] 45: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]: 1 tub of ice cream was discounted by 13 - 11 = 2 dollars.  Since you are buying 2 tubs, you will save 2 * 2 = 4 dollars on ice cream. 

A packet of milk was discounted by 0. 5 dollars.  Since you are buying 4 packets, you will save 0. 5 * 4 = 2 dollars on milk. 

In total, you will save 4 + 2 = 6 dollars.  The answer is 6. 
2 tubs of ice cream at $2 per tub (11 - 13) is 2 x 2 = 4.  A packet of milk is $0. 5, and you buy 4 packets, so that's 4 x 0. 5 = 2.  You will save 4 + 2 = 6.  The answer is 6. 
2 tubs of ice cream that are each $2 cheaper, so that's a savings of 2 x 2 = 4 dollars.  4 packets of milk at 0. 5 dollar savings each, so that's 4 x 0. 5 = 2 dollars.  Altogether, you will save 4 + 2 = 6 dollars.  The answer is 6. 
1 tub of ice cream is discounted by 2 dollars (13 - 11 = 2 dollars).  So, 2 tubs will be discounted by 2 * 2 = 4 dollars.  1 packet of milk is discounted by 0. 5 dollars, so 4 packets will be discounted by 0. 5 * 4 = 2 dollars.  4 dollars is saved on ice cream and 2 dollars is saved on milk.  So in total, we will save 4 + 2 = 6 dollars.  The answer is 6. 
2 tubs of ice cream at $11 each will cost 2 x 11 = 22 dollars.  The original cost was 2 x 13 = 26 dollars.  You will save 26 - 22 dollars.  26 - 22 is 4.  Then, you got 4 packets of milk at a discount of $0. 5.  So you will save 4 x 0. 5 = 2 dollars on milk.  The total amount saved is 2 + 4 = 6 dollars.  The answer is 6. 
 Let's first find the discount on the tub of ice cream.  The original price is $13 and the new price is $11, so the discount is $13 - $11 = $2. 

Now, let's find the discount on a packet of milk.  The original price is not given, but we know the discount is $0. 5.  So the new price of a packet of milk is $1 (since it is $0. 5 less than the original price). 

Now, let's calculate the discount on 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.  The total discount on the ice cream will be 2 x $2 = $4.  The total discount on the milk will be 4 x $0. 5 = $2.  So, the total discount will be $4 + $2 = $6.  The answer is 6. 
2 tubs of ice cream originally cost $13 each, so that's $13 x 2 = $26.  Now they cost $11 each, so 2 tubs of ice cream cost 2 x 11 = 22 dollars.  The discount is 26 - 22 = 4 dollars.  Now we need to consider the packets of milk.  4 packets of milk at a discount of $0. 5 each will be 4 * 0. 5 = 2 dollars.  You will save a total of 4 + 2 = 6 dollars.  The answer is 6 dollars. 
 If buying one tub of ice cream at the discounted price, you will save 13 - 11 = 2 dollars.  To buy 2 tubs of ice cream, you will save 2 x 2 = 4 dollars in total on the ice cream. 

The packet of milk was sold at a discount of $0. 5.  To buy 4 packets of milk, you will save 4 x 0. 5 = 2 dollars. 

So the total amount you will save is the sum of the savings on ice cream and milk, which is 4 + 2 = 6.  The answer is 6. 
2 tubs of ice cream at 11 dollars each will cost 2 x 11 = 22 dollars.  If the price was 13 dollars originally, the discount for the ice cream is 13 - 11 = 2 dollars.  So the discount for 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x 2 = 4 dollars.  

4 packets of milk at a discount of 0. 50 dollars each will cost 4 x 0. 5 = 2 dollars discount.  

The total discount will be 4 dollars for the ice cream and 2 dollars for milk.  So the total discount is 4 + 2 = 6 dollars.  The answer is 6. 
13 - 11 = 2 dollars saved for each tub of ice cream.  So for 2 tubs, you will save 2 x 2 = 4 dollars.  Another question: milk will have a discount of 0. 5.  So 4 packets will have 0. 5 * 4 = 2 dollars in saving.  Total saving is 4 + 2 = 6 dollars.  The answer is 6. 
2 tubs of ice cream will cost $11 x 2 = $22.  The original price for 2 tubs would be $13 x 2 = $26.  22 - 26 = 4.  So, the discount for the ice cream tubs is $4. 

For 4 packets of milk, the original price would be 4 x $1 = $4.  However, each packet has a discount of $0. 5, so the actual price is $1 - $0. 5 = $0. 5 per packet.  For 4 packets, the discount would be 4 x $0. 5 = $2. 

The total discount for both items is $4 (for the tubs) + $2 (for the milk) = $6.  The answer is 6. 
 Let's start by finding the saving for one tub of ice cream.  The original price is $13 and the discounted price is $11, so the saving is $13 - $11 = $2 per tub of ice cream.  

 Since Olivia is buying 2 tubs of ice cream, she will save 2 x 2 = 4 dollars on the ice cream. 

 For the packet of milk, the original price is not given, but the discount is $0. 5.  If the original price is x, then the discounted price will be x - $0. 5.  We are buying 4 packets of milk, so the total saving for the milk is 4 x $0. 5 = $2. 

 To find the total saving, add the saving for ice cream to the saving for milk: 4 (for ice cream) + 2 (for milk) = 6.  The answer is 6.

[EXP] 46: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Martha invited 2 families with 6 people, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 people.  She also invited 3 families with 4 people, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 people.  So in total she invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.  8 people couldn't come due to illness.  1/4 that number is 8/4 = 2 people who had previous commitments.  So 8 + 2 = 10 people were absent.  24 - 10 = 14.  The answer is 14. 
6 people each for 2 families is 6 x 2 = 12 people.  4 people each for 3 families is 4 x 3 = 12 people.  12 + 12 is 24 people invited initially.  8 people couldn't come due to illness, so 24 - 8 = 16 people could still come.  1/4 of 8 is 8 / 4 = 2.  So 2 people had previous commitments.  16 - 2 is 14.  The answer is 14. 
2 families with 6 people is 2 x 6 = 12 people.  3 families with 4 people is 3 x 4 = 12 people.  Total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.  Because 8 people couldn't come, that leaves 24 - 8 = 16 people.  Since 1/4 that number had previous commitments, 1/4 x 8 = 2 people couldn't come.  So 16 - 2 = 14 people actually show up.  The answer is 14. 
 Martha invited 2 families with 6 people, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.  She also invited 3 families with 4 people, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.  In total, Martha invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.  After 8 people couldn't come due to illness, Martha is left with 24 - 8 = 16 people.  1/4 of 8 people, which is 2, had previous commitments, so 16 - 2 = 14 people could come.  The answer is 14. 
 Martha started with 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 people.  She also had 3 families with 4 people each, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 more people.  12 + 12 = 24.  But 8 people couldn't come due to illness, so there are 24 - 8 = 16 people left.  And 1/4 of 8 = 2 more people had previous commitments, so that's 16 - 2 = 14 people.  The answer is 14. 
 Martha invites 2 families with 6 people each, so that is 2 x 6 = 12 people.  She invites 3 families with 4 people each, so that is 3 x 4 = 12 people.  In total, she invites 12 + 12 = 24 people.  Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, she is missing 8 people.  And 1/4 of that is 8/4 = 2 people.  So overall, she has 24 - 8 - 2 = 14 people attending the party.  The answer is 14. 
 Martha invited 2 families with 6 people, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 people.  She also invited 3 families with 4 people, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 people.  In total, she invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.  Eight people couldn't come, leaving 24 - 8 = 16 people.  Since 1/4 that number had previous commitments, that means 1/4 * 8 = 2 people didn't come due to previous commitments.  So, there would be 16 - 2 = 14 people who show up for Martha's party.  The answer is 14. 
 Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.  She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.  So, originally, she has 12 + 12 = 24 people.  8 people couldn't come, so she has 24 - 8 = 16 people left.  Then 1/4 of that number (8 / 4 = 2) had previous commitments.  So we subtract 2 people from the remaining 16, leaving 16 - 2 = 14.  The answer is 14. 
6 * 2 = 12 people from 2 families with 6 people.  4 * 3 = 12 people from 3 families with 4 people.  12 + 12 = 24 people invited.  8 people couldn't come due to illness.  A quarter of 8 people had previous commitments.  8/4 = 2 people.  So 8 people couldn't come.  2 people had previous commitments.  8 + 2 = 10 people who couldn't come.  24 people invited minus 10 people who couldn't come is 14 people who show up.  The answer is 14. 
8 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 of that (2) had previous commitments.  So 8 + 2 = 10 people didn't attend the party.  Martha initially invited 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people.  So initially, she invited a total of 2 * 6 = 12 and 3 * 4 = 12 people.  12 + 12 = 24 people.  After subtracting the 10 who didn't attend, the number of people who attended is 24 - 10 = 14.  The answer is 14. 
2 families with 6 people each means 2 x 6 = 12 people.  3 families with 4 people each means 3 x 4 = 12 people.  So total, Martha invited 12 + 12 = 24 people originally.  8 people couldn't come due to illness, so Martha lost 8 people.  Then she lost 1/4 that number which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.  So 8 + 2 = 10 people are missing.  The invitees she has left are 24 - 10 = 14 people.  The answer is 14. 
6 people for 2 families and 4 people for 3 families is 2 * 6 + 3 * 4 = 12 + 12 = 24 people.  So there were 24 people originally invited.  8 people couldn't come due to illness, so we subtract 8: 24 - 8 = 16.  1/4 that number had a previous commitment, which is 8/4 = 2.

[EXP] 47: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Jam has 26 pencils in total.  She has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils.  So, 3 boxes full of pencils must have been 26 - 2 = 24 pencils.  Each box must have 24 / 3 = 8 pencils.  Meg has 46 pencils.  So together, they have 24 + 46 = 70 pencils.  Each box can hold 8 pencils, so they need 70 / 8 = 9 boxes.  The answer is 9. 
 Jam has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, so originally there are a total of 26 pencils.  To find how many pencils are in each box, we subtract the 2 loose pencils from the total: 26 - 2 = 24.  Since the boxes give 24 pencils and there are 3 boxes, each box must give 24 / 3 = 8 pencils. 

Jam and Meg combined have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.  To find out how many boxes they need, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold: 72 / 8 = 9.  So they need 9 boxes.  The answer is 9. 
 Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils, plus 2 loose pencils.  So she has 3 + 2 = 5 boxes.  Each full box gives 1 box.  And the total number of pencils is 26, so 1 box has 26 / 3 = 8. 75 pencils.  Since you can't have a fraction of a box, Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils.  Jam and Meg need a total of 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.  So they need 72 / 8 = 9 boxes.  The answer is 9. 
 Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils.  So she has a total of 3 + 2 = 5 boxes and the total number of pencils is 26.  Each box has an unknown number of pencils, but we can find the number of pencils each box contains by subtracting the 2 loose pencils from the total to get the total number of pencils from boxes: 26 - 2 = 24.

We add the number of pencils Jam has (26) to the number Meg has (46) to get 26 + 46 = 72 pencils in total.  We know each box contains 8 pencils.  So, the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils is 72 ÷ 8 = 9.

In total, that is 1 + 3 + 0. 5 + 1. 5 + 2 = 8.  The answer is 8. 
 Let's break this down step by step:

* Monday's yoga class is 1 hour
* Tuesday's cooking class is 3 times as long, so it's 1 * 3 = 3 hours
* Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is 0. 5 hours (half-hour)
* Thursday's museum tour is half the length of the cooking class, so it's 3 / 2 = 1. 5 hours
* Friday's errands are 2 hours

Now, let's add up the total hours:
1 + 3 + 0. 5 + 1. 5 + 2 = 8 hours

The answer is 8 hours. 
 Peyton has a one-hour yoga class on Monday.  The cooking class is 3 times longer than the yoga class, so it lasts 1 x 3 = 3 hours.  On Wednesday, there is a half-hour cheese-tasting event, which is 0. 5 hours.  On Thursday, there is a museum tour that is half as long as the cooking class, so it is 3/2 = 1. 5 hours.

[EXP] 52: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Morgan's dad said she has 90 dollars.  She wants to spend 5 dollars on arcade tokens.  Each day of mini-golf is 5 dollars.  And each go-kart ride is 10 dollars.  So, 2 go-kart rides will cost 20 dollars.  So the total she needs will be 5 for tokens + 5 for mini-golf + 20 for go-karts = 30 dollars.  90 - 30 = 60 dollars left.  So she has 60 dollars to spend on the friends' mini-golf rounds.  Mini-golf cost 5 dollars, so 60 / 5 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
 Morgan has a budget of 90.  She wants to spend money on mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts.  Let's figure out how much she will spend on these activities:

- Mini-golf: 1 round for herself, and as many rounds as she can for her friends.  She wants to make sure everyone gets to play, so she'll invite as many friends as she can, until she runs out of money for mini-golf.  A round of mini-golf is $5, so after her own round, she'll spend an additional 5 x x = $5x dollars on mini-golf for her friends.  Since she has a budget of $90, the total amount she can spend on mini-golf is 90 - 5 - 5 = 80 dollars.  Therefore, she can invite x friends to play mini-golf. 
- Arcade tokens: $5 for herself and her friends.  She has 5 friends, so the cost for arcade tokens will be 5 + 5 = 10. 
- Go-karts: She wants to ride the go-karts twice, so that's 2 x 10 = $20. 
- Total cost: 5 + 5x + 10 + 20 = 30 + 5x

Since she has a budget of $90, 30 + 5x = 90, which means 5x = 60.  This means she can invite x = 12 friends to her birthday party.  The answer is 12.

[EXP] 59: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 200, [output]:  There are 40 cannolis in Allan's house.  He has twice as much corn as cannolis, so he has 40 x 2 = 80 corns.  After buying 60 more cannolis, he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.  But he bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis, so he has 80 - 40 = 40 corns.  Now he has 100 cannolis and 40 corns.  The total is 100 + 40 = 140.  The answer is 140. 
40 cannolis are in the house, and Allan has twice as much corn.  So he has 40 * 2 = 80 corns.  Then he bought 60 more cannolis.  So there are now 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.  He bought 40 fewer corns, so he now has 80 - 40 = 40 corns.  In total, he has 100 cannolis + 40 corns = 140.  The answer is 140. 
 Let's start by using the information that there is twice as much corn as cannolis.  If there are 40 cannolis, then there are 40 x 2 = 80 corns.  

Then, Allan bought 60 more cannolis, making the total number of cannolis 40 + 60 = 100.  Since Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.  

Now, we know there are 80 corns originally, and Allan bought 60 more, making the total number of corns 80 + 60 = 140. 

In total, there are 140 corns and 100 cannolis.  The answer is 140 + 100 = 240. 
 Allan has a total of 40 cannolis in his house initially.  Now, after buying 60 more, he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.  Earlier, it was mentioned that there are twice as much corn as cannolis.  So, there were 40 x 2 = 80 corns initially.  After buying 40 fewer corns, he has 80 - 40 = 40 corns now.  So the total number of corns and cannolis is 100 (cannolis) + 40 (corns) = 140.

5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.  This means 5% of the 1% candles that may explode will also smell like wet dog. 
There are 500 candles that may explode.  Out of these, 5% will smell like wet dog, which is 0. 05 x 500 = 25 candles. 

The answer is 25 candles. 
50000 candles are being made.  99% of them are guaranteed not to explode.  That leaves 1% that could explode.  1% of 50000 is 1/100 * 50000 = 500.  So 500 of the candles could explode.

Let x be the total number of cards he sold initially.  Then the amount he sold multiplied by 1. 5 should equal the amount he had, $50:

x * 1. 5 = 50

We can divide both sides by 1. 5:

The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for 576 dollars.  He sold 17 of them for 20 dollars each during the flash sale, so he earned 17 x 20 = 340 dollars.  He also sold the remaining 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers to the department store for 25 dollars each.  That is 31 x 25 = 775 dollars.  So in total he made 340 + 775 = 1115 dollars.  But he paid 576 dollars for the case of sneakers, so his total profit is 1115 - 576 = 539 dollars.  The answer is 539. 
 The salesman started with a case of 48 sneakers.  17 of them were sold on Monday.  After that, he had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.  He sold those for 25 dollars each.  31 * 25 = 775 dollars.  In total, he sold 17 sneakers for 20 dollars each, which would be 17 * 20 = 340.  So, in total, he made 340 + 775 = 1115 dollars.  It cost him 576 dollars to buy the initial case.  So his profit is 1115 - 576 = 539.  The answer is 539. 
 The salesman bought the sneakers for 576 dollars.  He sold 17 for 20 dollars each.  So, he earned 20 * 17 = 340 dollars from that.  Then, he sold the rest to a department store for 25 dollars each, and he had 48 - 17 = 31 remaining.  He earned 25 * 31 = 775 dollars from the department store.  He made a total of 340 + 775 dollars.  So the salesman made 1115 dollars.  The question is how much was his profit, which means how much more he made than the original cost.  1115 - 576 = 539.  The answer is 539. 
1st, the salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.  This means he got 48 sneakers for $576.  Let's call the money he paid for each sneaker 'x'.  Since there are 48 sneakers, he paid 48x for them.  The total amount he paid is the same as the price he paid for the case, which is $576, so 48x = 576.  To find x, we can divide both sides by 48 and get x = 576/48 = 12.  This means each sneaker cost $12. 

2nd, he sold 17 sneakers at a flash sale for $20 each, which is 17 x 20 = 340.  Then, 340 dollars was his profit from selling sneakers at the sale. 

3rd, he sold the rest of the sneakers to a department store for $25 each.  There are 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.  So he sold 31 sneakers for $25 each.  This is 31 x 25 = 775 dollars.  775 dollars is his total income from selling sneakers to the department store. 

4th, the salesman's total income is the sum of his income from both sale and the department store.  His total income is 340 + 775 = 1115. 

5th, since his total income was 1115 and the cost of sneakers is 48x = 48 * 12 = 576, the salesman's profit is 1115 - 576 = 539. 

The answer is 539 dollars.

[EXP] 66: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1920, [output]: 1 raised bed is 2 feet wide x 8 feet long x 2 feet tall = 2 x 8 x 2 = 32 cubic feet.  10 raised beds are 32 x 10 = 320 cubic feet.  Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = 160 bags of potting soil.  Each bag costs $12, so Bob will need 160 x 12 = 1920 dollars.  The answer is 1920. 
 First, we need to find the total volume of the raised beds.  Each bed is 2 x 8 x 2 = 32 cubic feet.  There are 10 beds, so the total volume is 10 x 32 = 320 cubic feet.  Then, we need to find how many bags of potting soil we need.  320 divided by 2 is 160 bags of potting soil.  Since each bag costs $12, the total cost will be 160 x 12 = 1920.  The answer is 1920. 
10 raised beds, each 2 feet x 8 feet x 2 feet is a volume of 32 cubic feet.  10 x 32 = 320 cubic feet of soil are needed.  Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.  Each bag costs 12 dollars, so the cost is 12 x 160 = 1920 dollars.  The answer is 1920. 
10 raised beds with dimensions 2 x 8 x 2 = 32 cubic feet in each.  So in total, Bob needs 10 x 32 = 320 cubic feet of soil.  Since each bag of soil holds 2 cubic feet, Bob needs 320/2 = 160 bags of soil.  160 bags of soil will cost 160 x 12 = 1920 dollars.  The answer is 1920. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find the total volume of soil needed for the raised beds.  Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall.  To find the volume, we multiply the dimensions: 2 x 8 x 2 = 32 cubic feet. 

Since there are 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 10 x 32 = 320 cubic feet. 

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil.  To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total volume by the capacity of each bag: 320 ÷ 2 = 160 bags. 

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is 160 x 12 = 1920. 

The answer is 1920. 
1 bed is 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.  Each bag holds 2 cubic feet, so each bed needs 32 / 2 = 16 bags.  16 bags * 10 beds = 160 bags needed.  Each bag cost $12, so 12 * 160 = 1920.  The answer is 1920. 
10 raised beds, each 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall is 2 x 8 x 2 cubic feet per bed.  So each bed is 32 cubic feet.  With 10 beds, Bob will need 32 x 10 = 320 cubic feet of potting soil.  Each bag of petting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so he needs 320 / 2 = 160 bags.  Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is 12 * 160 = 1920.  The answer is 1920. 
 First, we'll find the volume of soil needed for each raised bed.  We need to multiply the dimensions of each bed to find the volume: 2 x 8 x 2 = 32 cubic feet per bed.  Since Bob has 10 raised beds, we'll multiply the volume per bed by 10: 32 x 10 = 320 cubic feet of soil needed in total.  Then, we'll divide the total volume needed by the volume held per bag of potting soil to find out how many bags he needs: 320 / 2 = 160 bags of soil.

 Gabriel has 20 songs on his player.  Luri has 3 times more than Gabriel.  20 x 3 = 60.  So Luri has 60 songs on his player.  To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his, we need to find how many more songs Gabriel can add to his player.  Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs.  Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs.  Gabriel can add 80 - 40 = 40 more songs than Luri.  The answer is 40. 
 Gabriel has 20 songs.  Luri has 3 times as many as Gabriel, so 3 x 20 = 60 songs.  The question is asking how much less Gabriel can add compared to Luri.  So the difference is 60 - 20 = 40.  

The answer is 40. 
 Let's start by finding out how many songs Luri has on his player.  Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, who has 20 songs.  3 x 20 = 60.  So Luri has 60 songs. 

Now we know that Gabriel has 20 songs and Luri has 60 songs.  If both players can store 100 songs, we can find out how many more songs they can add by subtracting the current number of songs from the maximum capacity of 100. 

For Gabriel, he can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs. 

For Luri, he can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs. 

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we can subtract: 80 - 40 = 40. 

The answer is 40. 
 We see that Gabriel has 20 songs, and Luri has 3 times as many.  So Luri has 3 x 20 = 60 songs.  Now we must find out how many songs each can add before their player is full.  Gabriel's player is full at 100 songs, and he has 20 already.  He can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs.  Luri's player is also full at 100 songs, and he has 60 already.  He can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs.  So Luri has 80 - 40 = 40 fewer songs he can add than Gabriel.  The answer is 40. 
 Let's start by finding out how many songs Luri can add to his player.  Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel.  Gabriel has 20 songs, so Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs.  Now, these are the number of songs they have.  To find out how many they can add, we subtract the number they already have from 100 (the maximum capacity).  For Gabriel, he can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs.  For Luri, he can add 100 - 60 = 40 songs.  Since we want to know how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we subtract the number Luri can add from the number Gabriel can add.  80 - 40 = 40.  The answer is 40.

 She paid a total of $7.  Let's subtract the cost of the packs she bought, except for the 2 packs of strawberry gum: $7 - $2 - $1 = $4.  This is the total cost of the 2 packs of strawberry gum. 
Now we divide the cost of the 2 packs of strawberry gum by 2 to get the cost of one pack: $4 ÷ 2 = $2.  The answer is 2. 
 Suzie got 4 packs of gum.  She got 2 packs of strawberry and a pack of grape gum.  That leaves 4 - 3 = 1 pack of green apple gum.  She paid $7 for all the gum, so the total cost of the gum packs were $7.  The green apple gum cost half as much as the packs of grape gum.  $2 (pack of grape gum) / 2 = $1 (pack of green apple gum) So the total cost of the strawberry gum is $7 - $2 (pack of grape gum) - $1 (pack of green apple gum) = $7 - 3 = $4.

If each package of strawberry gum cost $x, then 2x = 4.  Divide both sides by 2 to get x = 2.  The answer is 2. ']

[EXP] 83: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 37, [output]: 1 loaf of bread costs $3. 00 and makes 10 sandwiches.  Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they use 1 loaf.  So, they spend $3. 00 on bread. 

They also spend $30. 00 on different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches. 

Total cost is: $3. 00 (bread) + $30. 00 (cheese and condiments) = $33. 00

They sell each sandwich for $7. 00, so they make 10 x $7. 00 = $70. 00

Net profit is: $70. 00 (revenue) - $33. 00 (cost) = $37. 00

The answer is 37. 
 Let's break down the costs:
- Bread: 3 dollars per loaf, 1 loaf makes 10 sandwiches, so 1 sandwich costs 3 / 10 = 0. 3 dollars.  
- Cheese and condiments: 30 dollars for 10 sandwiches, so 30 / 10 = 3 dollars per sandwich.  
- Total cost per sandwich: 0. 3 + 3 = 3. 3 dollars.  
Since they sell 10 sandwiches for 7 dollars each, their revenue is 10 * 7 = 70 dollars.  
- Net profit: Revenue - total cost per sandwich * number of sandwiches, 70 - 3. 3 * 10 = 70 - 33 = 37.  The answer is 37. 
 First, we find out how much each loaf costs.  3. 00 for the bread, plus 30. 00 for the cheeses and condiments, makes 33. 00 for 10 sandwiches.  33. 00 / 10 = 3. 30 per sandwich.  Then we calculate their profit when they sell 10 sandwiches.  10 sandwiches x 7. 00 = 70. 00.  70. 00 - 33. 00 = 37. 00.  The net profit is 37. 00. 

The answer is 37. 
 The food truck started with a cost for bread, so that is 10 sandwiches * 3 / 10 = 3. 00 dollars for the bread.  They also spent 30. 00 dollars on cheese and condiments, so 30. 00 more dollars in total.  So the total cost is 3. 00 + 30. 00 = 33. 00.  They sold the 10 sandwiches for 10 * 7. 00 = 70. 00.  Their profit is 70. 00 - 33. 00 = 37. 00.  The answer is 37. 
 In this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue, total cost, and then find the net profit. 

The total revenue is 10 sandwiches * 7 dollars per sandwich = 70 dollars. 

The cost of bread is 30 loaves * 3 dollars per loaf = 90 dollars.  But 30 loaves make 30 * 10 sandwiches = 300 sandwiches, so the cost of bread per 10 sandwiches is 90 / 30 = 3 dollars.  The total cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is 3 dollars. 

The cost of cheese and condiments is 30 dollars per 10 sandwiches.  

The total cost for 10 sandwiches is the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments, which is 3 dollars + 30 dollars = 33 dollars. 

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is 70 - 33 = 37 dollars.  The answer is 37. 
 The food truck starts with $30. 00 for cheeses and condiments.  This covers 10 sandwiches.  Since they sell only sandwiches, they sell 10 sandwiches.  They also buy 1 loaf of bread for 3. 00 dollars, which makes 10 sandwiches.  So the total cost is equal to 30 + 3 = 33 dollars.  They sell 10 sandwiches for 10 x 7 = 70 dollars.  To find the profit, subtract the cost from the revenue.  70 - 33 = 37.  The answer is 37. 
 We can break this problem down into several steps.  

First, let's find out how much bread they need in total.  They make 10 sandwiches per loaf and they sell 10 sandwiches, so they need 1 loaf.  But since they might sell more than 10 sandwiches, we don't know how many loaves they need.  

Next, let's find out how much it costs to make 10 sandwiches.  The bread costs $3. 00 per loaf, and they need 1 loaf.  So, for the bread, it costs $3. 00.  The food truck spends $30. 00 on different cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches.  So, for making 10 sandwiches, they spend $30. 00 on the cheeses and condiments.  Therefore, the total cost of making 10 sandwiches is $3. 00 + $30. 00 = $33. 00.  

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 10 sandwiches.  They sell each sandwich for $7. 00, and they sell 10 sandwiches.  So, their revenue is 10 x $7. 00 = $70. 00.  

Finally, let's find their net profit.  Their revenue is $70. 00, and their cost is $33. 00.  So, their net profit is $70. 00 - $33. 00 = $37. 00.  The answer is 37.

[EXP] 85: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 52, [output]:  Jared started with 47 WPM.  After increasing to 52, he increased by 52 - 47 = 5 WPM.  To increase again by 5 WPM, he will be at 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.  To find the average of the three measurements, we add the three measurements and divide by 3: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.  The answer is 52. 
 Jared's original typing speed is 47 WPM.  Then it becomes 52 WPM.  Since it will increase by 5 WPM again, it will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.  The average of the three measurements is (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 52.  The answer is 52. 
 Jared originally typed 47 WPM.  Then he typed 52 WPM, which is 52 - 47 = 5 words faster.  After increasing 5 words, he will type 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.  The average of the three measurements is: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.  The answer is 52. 
47 is Jared's original typing speed.  Then he increased to 52, which is 52 - 47 = 5 more WPM.  Then, he will increase his speed again by 5 WPM.  So, 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.  Now we need to find the average of the three measurements.  The average is (47 + 52 + 57) / 3.  47 + 52 + 57 is 156.  156 / 3 is 52.  The answer is 52. 
47 is his original rate.  Then he increased by 52.  So he has 52 WPM.  After increasing again by 5, he will have 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.  We need the average of 47, 52, and 57.  To get the average, we add them up and divide by 3.  (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = (156) / 3 = 52.  The answer is 52. 
Initially, Jared had 47 words per minute (WPM).  After some lessons, he increased to 52 WPM.  He increased by 52 - 47 = 5 WPM.  If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, he will have 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.  To find the average of the three measurements, we need the sum first: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.  Then divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52. 
The answer is 52. 
 Let's first find the increase in WPM after the lessons.  He went from 47 to 52, which is a difference of 52 - 47 = 5 words.  Then, if he increases his typing speed by 5 more words, it will be 52 + 5 = 57 words.  To find the average of these three measurements, we need to add them up and divide by 3.  The sum of the three measurements is 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.  Divide by 3, and we get 156 / 3 = 52.  The answer is 52. 
 Jordan starts with 47 WPM.  After increasing to 52 WPM, there was an increase of 52 - 47 = 5 WPM.  But then he will increase it by 5 more, which is another 5 WPM increase after 52.  So now it will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.  The average of 47, 52, and 57 is (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = (156) / 3 = 52.  The answer is 52. 
47 is Jared's starting typing speed.  After one lesson, it increased to 52.  52 - 47 is 5.  So the increase is 5 words.  To increase it by 5 words, he will have 52 + 5 = 57.  To find the average, add up all three typing speeds and divide by 3. 

47 + 52 + 57 = 156

Divide by 3:

156 / 3 = 52

The answer is 52. 
 Jared initially had 47 words per minute.  Then he had 52 words per minute.  Continuing by increasing by 5 words, he will have 52 + 5 = 57 words per minute.  To find the average, we first add the three measurements and divide by the number of measurements.  So, 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.  We divide 156 by 3, since we have three measurements.  156 / 3 = 52.  The answer is 52. 
47 is the initial typing speed.  After his speed has increased to 52 WPM, the difference is 52 - 47 = 5 WPM.  That means the increase is 5 WPM for another round.  By the end of this round, his typing speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.  

The average typing speed is the mean of the three measurements: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = (156) / 3 = 52.

[EXP] 86: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Let's call Jerry's current age "x".  Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means he was x-5 years old 5 years ago. 

We can set up the equation: x = 2(x-5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives: -x = -10

Adding 10 to both sides gives: x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

The answer is 13. 
 Jerry is currently X years old.  He was X - 5 years old 5 years ago.  Since he is twice as old now, we can set up the equation X = 2(X - 5).  Solving the equation gives X = 10.  So Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13.  The answer is 13. 
 Let's start by saying Jerry's current age is x.  Then, 5 years ago, Jerry's age would have been x-5. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x-5)

Simplify the equation by solving for x:

x = 2x - 10

Add 10 to both sides of the equation to get:

x + 10 = 2x

Subtract x from both sides to get:

10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

The answer is 13. 
 Let's first figure out how old Jerry is now.  If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means Jerry's current age - 5 is equal to half of his current age.  We can set up an equation to represent this:

Jerry's current age - 5 = (1/2) × Jerry's current age

We can solve for Jerry's current age:

Jerry's current age = 10

Now that we know Jerry's current age, we can find out how old he will be in 3 years:

Jerry's age in 3 years = Jerry's current age + 3
= 10 + 3
= 13

So, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.  The answer is 13. 
 Let's call Jerry's current age "x".  Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means that 5 years ago, he was x/2 years old.  If x/2 + 5 = x, then x = 10 (Jerry is 10 years old now). 

If Jerry is 10 years old now, and he will be the same age in 3 years, then he will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old in 3 years.  The answer is 13. 
 Let's find out how old Jerry is now.  Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago.  Let's call his current age "x".  Then, 5 years ago, he was "x - 5" old.  Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so x = 2(x-5).  Solving for x, we get x = 10. 

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.  To find out how old he will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13.  The answer is 13. 
 Jerry's current age is unknown, for now, let's call it x.  According to the problem, we know that he was x - 5 years old 5 years ago, and now he is twice as old, meaning he is now 2(x - 5).  We can set up the equation:

2(x - 5) = x

To solve for x, we can move all terms to one side:

2x - 10 = x

Subtract x from both sides:

x = 10

Now we know Jerry's current age is 10.  To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3:

10 + 3 = 13

The answer is 13.

 Let's break this problem down step by step!

1.  Steve is 60 years old. 
2.  His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old. 
3.  Their son is currently half as old as his mom, who is 64 years old.  So the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old. 
4.  His son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, who is 32 years old.  So his son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old. 

The answer is 29. 
1.  We know that Steve's wife is 4 years older than him, so her age is 60 + 4 = 64. 

2.  We know that Steve's son is currently half as old as his mom, so his age is 64 / 2 = 32. 

3.  We know that Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so her age is 32 - 3 = 29. 


The answer is 29. 
 Steve is 60 years old.  His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64.  The son is half as old as their mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32.  Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than him, so Steve's son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29.  The answer is 29. 
 First, let's find Steve's wife's age.  If she is 4 years older than Steve, then she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old. 

Next, their son is half as old as his mom, so he is 64 / 2 = 32 years old. 

Finally, his wife is 3 years younger than Steve's son, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.  The answer is 29. 
1.  Steve is 60 years old. 
2.  Steve's wife is 4 years older, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old. 
3.  Their son is half as old as his mom.  The mom is 64 years old, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old. 
4.  The son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband.  The son is 32 years old.  32 - 3 = 29. 
The answer is 29. 
 First, let's figure out the ages of everyone.  Steve is 60 years old.  His wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 60 + 4 = 64. 

Their son is half as old as his mom, so he is half of 64.  Half of 64 is 32. 

Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so we subtract 3 from 32 to get 29.  The answer is 29. 
 Let's start by finding Steve's wife's age.  She is 4 years older than Steve, so Steve's wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.  

Then, their son is half as old as his mom.  So, their son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old. 

Then, Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than Steve's son.  So Steve's son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old. 

The answer is 29. 
1.  First, let's figure out the age of Steve's wife.  She is 4 years older than Steve, so her age is 60 + 4 = 64. 
2.  Now, Steve's son is half as old as his mom, which is half of 64, so he is 64 ÷ 2 = 32 years old. 
3.  Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than him, so her age is 32 - 3 = 29 years old. 

The answer is 29. 
1.  First, let's find the age of Steve's wife: She is 4 years older than Steve, who is 60 years old.  So her age is 60 + 4 = 64. 
2.  Next, let's find the age of their son: Their son is half as old as his mom, who is 64 years old.  So his age is (64) / 2 = 32. 
3.  Finally, let's find the age of Steve's son's wife: She is 3 years younger than her husband, the son, who is 32 years old.  So her age is 32 - 3 = 29. 

The answer is 29. 
1.  First, we calculate Steve's wife's age.  Steve is 60 years old.  His wife is 4 years older, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old. 
2.  Then, we calculate their son's age.  Since their son is currently half as old as his mom, his age is 64/2 = 32 years old. 
3.  Finally, we calculate Steve's son's wife's age.  Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, which is 32 years old.  So, Steve's son's wife's age is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

[EXP] 94: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2100, [output]:  Ariadne had 400 dollars from red hats.  Since that is half of the sales from green hats, she had 2 x 400 = 800 dollars from green hats in the first month.  In two months, she made 400 + 800 = 1200 dollars.  The second month's sales are 3/4 of the first month's sales.  So in the second month, she made (3/4) x 1200 = 900 dollars.  In total, she made 1200 + 900 = 2100 dollars.  The answer is 2100. 
 Ariadne sold $400 in red hats.  If this is half of the total she made from green hats, then she must have made 2 x 400 = 800 from green hats.  In total, she made 800 + 400 = 1200 in the first month. 

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.  Since 3/4 of 1200 is the same as 3/4 x 1200 = 900, she made 900 in the second month. 

So, the total amount she made in 2 months is 1200 + 900 = 2100.  The answer is 2100. 
 Let's break this down step by step.  In the first month, Ariadne sold $400 worth of red hats.  This is half of the total amount she earned selling green hats.  If she earned $400 from red hats, then she earned $800 from green hats.  In total, she earned $800 + $400 = $1200 in the first month. 

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.  3/4 of $1200 is $900.  This means in the second month she earned $900. 

In two months, she earned a total of $1200 + $900 = $2100.  The answer is 2100. 
400 is half of the total amount she earned from selling green hats.  This means that the total amount she earned from selling green hats is 400 * 2 = 800.  Then the total amount in one month is 400 + 800 = 1200 dollars. 

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the first month's sales.  In the first month she earned 1200 dollars, and in the second month she earned 3/4 of that which is 1200 * (3/4) = 900.  Then the total amount in two months is 1200 + 900 = 2100.  The answer is 2100. 
 First, let's figure out the sales of the green hats in the first month.  If the sales of red hats are half of the total amount she earned from selling green hats, that means the sales of green hats in the first month are 2 x 400 = 800. 

Now, let's add this to the sales of red hats to get the total amount Ariadne made in the first month: 400 + 800 = 1200. 

For the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.  So we need to multiply the total sales of the first month by 3/4 to get the sales of the second month: 1200 x (3/4) = 900. 

To get the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we add the sales of the first month to the sales of the second month: 1200 + 900 = 2100.  The answer is 2100. 
 Firstly, Ariadne sold 400 dollars from red hats.  Green hat sales must have been twice that, because they are equal to the total amount earned from red hats.  So green hat sales were 400 x 2 = 800.  Total amount in the first month is 400 + 800 = 1200.  

In the second month, the sales from green hats were 3/4 of the first month.  Green hat sales are (3/4) x 800 = 600.  Red hat sales are half that, so 600 ÷ 2 = 300.  

Total amount in the second month is 300 + 600 = 900.  To find the total amount she made in two months, we add: 1200 + 900 = 2100.  The answer is 2100. 
 Let's start with the clue "Her sales from red hats were $400 in a particular month, half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. " This means that if x is the total amount earned from selling green hats, then x/2 = 400.  This means x = 800. 

Now, Ariadne made this same amount in the first month, but $400 is the amount from red hats.  Therefore, the total amount earned in the first month is 800 (from green hats) + 400 (from red hats) = 1200. 

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.  So, 3/4 x 1200 = 900. 

Since she made $1200 in the first month, we can find the total amount she made in two months by adding the first month's sales (1200) to the second month's sales (900).  1200 + 900 = 2100.  The answer is 2100.

[EXP] 100: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 68, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

There are 14 red squares. 

Blue squares: 4 more than red, so 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares. 

Green squares: 6 more than blue, so 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. 

White squares: 12 fewer than green, so 24 - 12 = 12 white squares. 

In total, there are 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares. 

Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area is 68 squares x 1 foot x 1 foot = 68 square feet. 

The answer is 68. 
 Brittany's comforter has 14 red squares.  Since it has 4 more blue squares than red squares, it has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares. 
Since it has 6 more green squares than blue squares, it has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. 
Since it has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, it has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares. 

There are 14 red squares, 18 blue squares, 24 green squares, and 12 white squares.  That is a total of 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares. 

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.  The answer is 68. 
 Brittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares.  The comforter had 14 red squares.  If there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, then there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.  If there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, then there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.  If there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, then there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares. 

There are 14 red, 18 blue, 24 green, and 12 white squares.  The total number of squares is 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.  Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 squares x 1 foot x 1 foot = 68 square feet.  The answer is 68 square feet. 
 There are 14 red squares.  There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.  There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.  There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.   To find the total number of square feet, we multiply the number of squares in each color by the number of square feet each square is, and then add those together.  14 x 1 = 14, 18 x 1 = 18, 24 x 1 = 24, 12 x 1 = 12.  14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68.  The answer is 68. 
 The comforter has 14 red squares.  It has 4 more blue squares than red squares, so that is 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.  It has 6 more green squares than blue squares, so that is 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.  It has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so that is 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.  To find the total number of squares, we add up 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.  Each square is a foot by a foot, so each square is 1 square foot.  The total square feet is 68 * 1 = 68.  The answer is 68. 
 Let's start by finding the number of blue squares.  There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18. 

Next, let's find the number of green squares.  There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24. 

Finally, let's find the number of white squares.  There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12. 

Now, let's sum up the areas of all the colored squares:

* Red squares: 14 x 1 ft² = 14 ft²
* Blue squares: 18 x 1 ft² = 18 ft²
* Green squares: 24 x 1 ft² = 24 ft²
* White squares: 12 x 1 ft² = 12 ft²

The total area of the comforter is the sum of the areas of all the colored squares: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 ft². 

The answer is 68. 
 Brittany's quilted comforter has 14 red squares.  There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so she has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.  There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so she has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.  There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so she has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares. 

The total number of squares in the comforter is the sum of the number of red, blue, green, and white squares: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares. 

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, each square is 1 square foot.  To find the square feet of the comforter, multiply the number of squares by 1 square foot: 68 x 1 = 68 square feet.  The answer is 68. 
 Brittany's comforter has the following number of 1x1 squares: 
- Red: 14
- Blue: 14 + 4 = 18
- Green: 18 + 6 = 24
- White: 24 - 12 = 12

To find the total square feet, we need to multiply the number of each color by 1 foot and sum them up:
14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
The answer is 68. 
14 red squares.  Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.  6 more green squares than blue squares means there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.  12 fewer white squares than green squares means there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.  To find the total square feet, we need to multiply the number of squares by 1 foot times 1 foot.  That's the same as multiplying by 1 square foot.  So the total number of square feet is 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 square feet.  The answer is 68. 
1 foot by 1 foot colored squares.  Brittany has:

- 12 fewer white squares than green squares, that's 24 - 12 = 12

Total number of squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area is:
68 squares x 1 foot by 1 foot = 68 square feet. 

The answer is 68. 
 Brittany starts with 14 red squares, and 4 more blue squares than red.  So she has 4 + 14 = 18 blue squares.  Then, she has 6 more green squares than blue squares, so 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.  Finally, she has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

 Helga has two different tap rates, 300 and 250.  But we need to know how many times both feet tap.  300 + 250 = 550, so their feet tap a total of 550 times per minute.  For 3 minutes with her arms down, that would be 3 x 550 = 1650 taps.  For 2 minutes with her arms up, that would be 2 x 200 = 400 taps.  So the combined total would be 1650 + 400 = 2050.

 Helga is multi-tasking, isn't she?

Let's break it down:

Initially, with her arms at her sides, Helga taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute.  So, the total taps per minute is:

300 (right foot) + 250 (left foot) = 550 taps per minute

She dances for 3 minutes with her arms at her sides, so the total number of taps during this period is:

550 taps/minute x 3 minutes = 1650 taps

Next, she raises her arms and her foot-tapping rate slows down to 200 taps per minute for both feet.  She dances for 2 minutes with her arms raised, so the total number of taps during this period is:

200 taps/minute x 2 minutes = 400 taps

The total number of taps during the entire 5-minute dance is the sum of the taps from both periods:

1650 (arms at her sides) + 400 (arms raised) = 2050 taps

The answer is 2050. 
 Helga taps her feet at 300 taps per minute with both hands at her sides.  She taps her feet at 250 taps per minute with both feet.  She dances for 3 out of 5 minutes with her hands at her sides and 2 minutes with them raised.  So she taps her feet the two feet times the following amounts:

3 x (300 + 250) = 3 x 550 = 1650
2 x 200 = 400

 Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 100 * 0. 20 = 20 votes.  Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, so they got 20 + 20 x 0. 5 = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.  This means candidate C got 100 - 20 - 30 = 50 votes.  The answer is 50. 
20% of the votes is 20/100 * 100 = 20 votes.  Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A, so 20 + (50/100 * 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.  The total votes are 20 + 30 = 50, so the remaining 100 - 50 = 50 votes went to candidate C.  The answer is 50. 
20% of 100 is 0. 20 x 100 = 20 votes for candidate A.  Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A, so it's 50% of 20 = 0. 5 x 20 = 10 more votes.  So candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.  The rest of the votes went to candidate C, which is 100 - (20 + 30) = 50 votes.  The answer is 50. 
20% of the votes is 20% * 100 = 20 votes.  Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A, which is 50% * 20 = 10 more votes.  So candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.  The total number of votes is 20 (A) + 30 (B) + C.  To find C, we subtract from the total: 100 - 20 - 30 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
100 votes in total.  Candidate A got 20% of 100, which is 20.  Candidate B got 50% more, which is 50% of 20, which is 0. 5 x 20 = 10.  So candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.  The rest of the votes, or 100 - 20 - 30 = 50 votes was given to candidate C.  The answer is 50. 
20% means 20 out of 100, or 0. 2 * 100 = 20.  Candidate A got 20 votes. 


Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, which is 20 * 1. 5 = 30 votes. 


The total number of votes is 100.  20 + 30 = 50.  The rest of the votes is 100 - 50 = 50. 


Candidate C got 50 votes.  The answer is 50. 
20% of 100 is 20. 

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A, so he got:
20 + (20 * 0. 5) = 20 + 10 = 30

Candidate A and B together got 30 + 20 = 50 votes. 
They are 50 out of 100, so candidate C got:
100 - 50 = 50

The answer is 50. 
20% of 100 is 20 votes for candidate A.  Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A, which is 20 + 0. 5 * 20 = 30 votes.  So candidate B got 30 votes.  The total votes are 20 + 30 + candidate C's votes.  If there are 100 voters and we know that candidate A and B got 20 and 30 votes respectively, then candidate C got 100 - 20 - 30 = 50 votes.  The answer is 50. 
100% of the votes subtracted from the votes of candidates A and B is what candidate C got. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes.  That is 0. 2 x 100 = 20 votes. 

Candidate B got 50% more votes than A.  That means B got 20 + (0. 5 x 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

[EXP] 107: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]: 80 students are in total in both classes.  Since each class has the same number of students, let's call the number of students in each class x.  Then 2x = 80, and x = 40.  Since each class has 40 students, 40% of 40 are girls.  That is 0. 4 * 40 = 16 girls in each class.  To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.  40 - 16 is 24.  The answer is 24. 
80 is the total number of students.  Since each class has the same number of students, let's call the number of students in each class x.  Then we know that 2x = 80, so x = 40.  Each class has 40 students.  40% of students in each class are girls.  That means 60% of students are boys.  So, in each class, the number of boys is 0. 6x.  Since x = 40, the number of boys in each class is 0. 6 * 40 = 24.  The answer is 24. 
 Let's break it down step by step.  Let's say the number of students in each class is x.  Since there are two classes, the total number of students is 2x.  We know that 2x = 80, so x = 40.  Each class has 40 students.  40% of the students in each class are girls.  40% of 40 is 40/100 * 40 = 16.  This means there are 16 girls in each class.  That leaves 40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.  The answer is 24. 
80 students in total, split into 2 classes with the same number of students.  Let that number be x.  Then we have the equation 2x = 80.  This means x = 40.  So, each class has 40 students. 

40% of the students are girls.  This means the number of girls in each class is 0. 4 * 40 = 16. 

40 - 16 = 24 boys are in each class.  The answer is 24. 
80 students are in both classes together.  If both classes have the same number, let's say that number is x.  Then x + x = 80.  So 2x = 80.  Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 40.  So each class has 40 students.  

Now, 40% of the students in each class are girls.  So in one class, 40% of 40 are girls.  40% of 40 is 40 * 0. 4 = 16.  So there are 16 girls in one class.  The rest of the students are boys.  There are 40 - 16 = 24 boys in one class. 

There are two classes, so there are 24 boys in each class.  The answer is 24. 
40% of the students in each class are girls.  So the remaining 60% of the students are boys.  Let's assume there are x students in each class.  40% of x is 0. 4x and 60% of x is 0. 6x.  So there are 0. 6x boys and 0. 4x girls.  The total number of students is 80, so we can write the equation 0. 6x + 0. 4x = 80.  0. 6x + 0. 4x is 1x, so the equation is x = 80.  So there are 80 students total and each class has the same number of students.  Therefore, each class has 80/2 = 40 students.  Out of 40 students, 40% are girls.  40% of 40 is 0. 4 x 40 = 16.  So 16 are girls and the remaining 40 - 16 = 24 are boys.  The answer is 24. 
40% of the students in each class are girls, so 60% of the students are boys.  In each class, boys and girls add up to a total number of students.  So 60% + 40% of the students in each class must be equal to half of the total students.  Let's call the number of students in each class x.  Then:

0. 6x + 0. 4x = 80/2
0. 6x + 0. 4x = 40
1. 0x = 40
x = 40

So there are 40 students in each class.  To find the number of boys, we will find the number of girls first.  40% of the students in each class are girls.  40% of 40 is 0. 4 x 40 = 16.  So there are 16 girls in each class.  Then the number of boys in each class is 40 - 16 = 24.

[EXP] 109: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]: 33 council members.  The number of votes against the new regulation is x.  The number of votes in favor is 2x.  2x + x = 33.  3x = 33.  Divide both sides by 3, x = 11.  There are 11 votes against the new regulation.  So the number of votes in favor is 2x = 2 * 11 = 22.  The answer is 22. 
33 people are on the council.  The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it.  So, let's say the number of votes against the regulation is x.  Then, the number of votes in favor would be 2x. 

The total number of votes is the number of votes in favor plus the number of votes against, which is x + 2x = 3x. 

Since there are 33 people on the council, the total number of votes is 33.  So, we can set up the equation 3x = 33. 

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3, which gives us x = 11. 

So, the number of votes against the regulation is 11, and the number of votes in favor is 2x = 22. 

The answer is 22. 
33 people voted, and there were twice as many in favor as against, so the number of votes against was x and in favor was 2x.  x + 2x = 33, so x = 11.  If there were 11 votes against, then there were 2x = 2*11 = 22 votes in favor.  The answer is 22. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 

There are 33 people on the council.  The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is equal to twice the number of votes against the new regulation.  Let's call the number of votes against the new regulation "x".  Then, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x. 

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against: 2x + x = 33. 

Combining like terms, 3x = 33. 

Dividing both sides by 3, x = 11. 

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11.  Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2(11) = 22. 

The answer is 22. 
 If there are 33 people on the council, and the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice as many as the number of votes against it, let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is x.  Then the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x. 

The total number of votes on the council is 33.  The sum of the votes for and against the regulation is 33.  We can write an equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

The number of votes against the new regulation is 11.  The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x = 2(11) = 22. 

The answer is 22. 
33 people in total.  Let's say the number of votes against the regulation is a.  Then the number of votes in favor of the regulation is 2a.  We know that a + 2a = 33.  So 3a = 33.  Divide both sides by 3 to get a = 11.  This means there were 11 votes against the regulation.  And there were twice as many votes in favor, so 2 * 11 = 22 votes in favor of the regulation.  The answer is 22. 
33 people on the council.  The vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it.  Let's call the number of votes against the regulation "x".  Then the number of votes in favor is 2x.  We know that x + 2x = 33.  We can combine the x's on the left side: 3x = 33.  To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 33 / 3.  x is 11.  Since there are 2x votes in favor, 2x is 2 * 11 = 22.  The answer is 22. 
 There are 33 people on the council.  Let's assume that "x" number of votes were against the new regulation and 2x were in favor.  

So, we can write the equation as: 2x + x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide by 3: x = 11

There were 11 votes against the regulation.  So, there were 2x = 2 * 11 = 22 votes in favor of the regulation.  The answer is 22. 
33 is the total number of votes, including both the votes in favor and the votes against.  If there were twice as many votes in favor as there were against, then the number of votes against is x and the number of votes for is 2x.  Since the total number of votes is 33, we can set up the equation x + 2x = 33.  Combining like terms, we get 3x = 33.  Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 11.  This means that there were 11 votes against the new regulation.  Because there are twice as many votes for as there were against, there were 11 * 2 = 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.  The answer is 22. 
 There are 33 people on the council.  Let's assume there were x votes against the new regulation.  The number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, so that's 2x. 

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes for and against: 2x + x = 3x. 

Since there are 33 people, the total number of votes is also 33: 3x = 33. 

To find the number of votes in favor, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 33/3. 

x is equal to 11.  So 11 people voted against the new regulation. 

The number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, so it is 2x = 2 * 11 = 22.  The answer is 22. 
33 people are on the council, and there are an equal number of people voted against the new regulation and in favor of it, except that there are twice as many in favor.  Let's call the number of people voting against the regulation "x".  Then the number of people voting in favor is 2x. 

We know that the sum of those who voted in favor and against is 33.  So we can write the equation:

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

[EXP] 110: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, let's call the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house x.  Then, the first house needs x/2 cases. 

The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2*(x/2) = x cases. 

The first two houses together need x + (x/2) = 3x/2 cases. 

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250, so:

x + (x/2) + x = 250

Combine like terms:

3x/2 + x = 250

Add x/2 to both sides:

3x = 250 + x/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

6x = 500 + x

Subtract x from both sides:

5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

So the second house needs 100 cases of shingles, and the first house needs 1/2 of that, which is 50 cases. 

The third house needs double the first house, which is 2 * 50 = 100 cases. 

The answer is 100. 
 Let's break this down step by step. 

The three houses need a total of 250 cases of shingles.  We're given that the first house needs half of what the second house needs.  Let's call the number of cases the second house needs "x".  Then the first house needs 1/2*x cases. 

The third house needs double what the first house needs, so it needs 2*(1/2*x) = x cases. 

We know that the three houses together need 250 cases, so we can set up the equation:

x + (1/2*x) + x = 250

Combine like terms:

1. 5x + x = 250

Combine the x terms:

2. 5x = 250

Divide both sides by 2. 5:

x = 100

So the second house needs 100 cases of shingles.  Since the first house needs half of this, it needs 100/2 = 50 cases.  The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2*50 = 100 cases. 

The answer is 100. 
1st house needs 1/2 of 2nd house.  2nd house needs x.  So 1st house needs x/2.  3rd house needs 2x.  Total is x + x/2 + 2x = 250.  Simplifying the equation, we get 5x/2 = 250.  Multiply both sides by 2 to get 5x = 500.  Divide both sides by 5 to get x = 100.  So the 2nd house needs 100 cases.  Since the 3rd house needs double the 1st, the 3rd house needs 2 times the first house.  Since the 1st house is 1/2 of the 2nd house, it will be 1/2 of 100 which is 50.  So the 3rd house needs 2 x 50 = 100 cases.  The answer is 100. 
250 is the total number of cases of shingles needed for the 3 houses.  If the first house needs 1/2 the second, that means the second needs 2 times what the first needs.  If let's say the first house needs x, then the second house needs 2x and the third house needs 2 times the first, which is 2x. 

x + 2x + 2x = 5x

Since the total is 250, 5x = 250.  To find x, we divide by 5:

x = 250 / 5
x = 50

So the first house needs 50 cases of shingles.  The second house needs 2 times that, which is 100.  The third house needs twice the first, which is also 100. 

The answer is 100. 
1/2 of the second means the second house will get half the number of shingles as the second house.  So, call the second house's number of shingles x.  The first house gets x/2.  The third house gets double the first, which is 2 times x/2 = x. 

The total number of shingles needed is 250.  The second and first houses' shingles add up to x + x/2 = 3x/2.  The third house gets x.  So:

3x/2 + x = 250

Combine like terms:

5x/2 = 250

Multiply both sides by 2:

5x = 500

 Divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

So the second house needs 100 cases.  The first house needs 100/2 = 50 cases.  The third house needs double the first house, which is 2 times 50 = 100 cases.  The answer is 100. 
250 cases of shingles will be used in total.  The first house needs half the amount of the second.  The second house needs some amount of shingles.  If the first house needs half the amount, then the second house must need twice the amount of the first.  The third house needs double the first, so it needs twice the amount of the first house. 

Let's say the first house needs x cases of shingles.  The second house needs 2x, and the third house needs 2x as well (because it doubles the first house). 

We know that 1/2 of the second house is needed for the first house.  So, the second house needs 2x cases of shingles, and the first house needs 1/2 * 2x = x cases. 

The total needed is 250, so we can set up the equation: x + 2x + 2x = 250

Combine like terms: 5x = 250

Divide both sides by 5: x = 50

The first house needs 50 cases of shingles, the second house needs 2x = 2 * 50 = 100 cases, and the third house needs 2 * 50 = 100 cases. 

So, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.  The answer is 100.

The remaining movies are 400 - 160 = 240 movies.  These are normal movies costing 10 dollars each.  So the cost for these is 240 * 10 = 2400. 

In total, the cost is 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 dollars.  The answer is 4400. 
1/3 of 600 movies are in series, so that's 600 / 3 = 200 movies.  Those will cost 200 * 6 = 1200 dollars.  The remaining 600 - 200 = 400 movies are split into two groups: 40% older movies (40% of 400 = 0. 4 * 400 = 160 movies) and the rest normal movies.  The older movies cost 5 dollars each, so they'll be 160 * 5 = 800 dollars.  The normal movies will cost 400 - 160 = 240 movies * 10 dollars each = 2400 dollars.  Adding all together, 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 dollars.  The answer is 4400. 
600 movies in total.  A third of these movies are part of a series and cost $6 each.  So we calculate a third of 600 movies: 600 / 3 = 200 movies.  Each one costs $6, so this will be 200 * 6 = 1200 dollars. 

Now we're left with 600 - 200 = 400 movies that are not part of a series. 

40% of these movies are older, so we calculate 40% of 400 movies: 0. 40 * 400 = 160 movies.  Each one costs $5, so this will be 160 * 5 = 800 dollars. 

There are 400 - 160 = 240 regular movies left.  Each one costs $10, so this will be 240 * 10 = 2400 dollars. 

The total cost will be 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 dollars.  The answer is 4400. 
 Mike has 600 movies.  A third of them are part of a series, so that is 600 / 3 = 200 movies.  The cost of these movies will be 200 * $10 = $2000.  However, he can get these at $6 each, which is 200 * $6 = $1200.  So the cost for 200 movies will be $1200. 

40% of the remaining 600 - 200 = 400 movies are older movies, which will cost $5 each.  40% of 400 is 400 * 0. 4 = 160 movies that are older.  The cost for these will be 160 * $5 = $800. 

For the remaining movies that are not part of a series and are not older, they will cost $10 each.  There are 400 - 160 = 240 movies left.  The cost for these will be 240 * $10 = $2400. 

In total, Mike needs to pay $1200 (for the series movies) + $800 (for the older movies) + $2400 (for the remaining movies) = $4400.  The answer is 4400. 
1/3 of the movies are in series and cost less.  Since a third of the movies are in series, that means 2/3 of the movies are not in series.  1/3 of 600 is 200, so 200 movies are in series.  And 2/3 is 400, so those are not in series. 

From 400 movies, 40% are older movies.  40% of 400 is 0. 4 x 400 = 160 movies that are older movies and cost $5 each.  The rest will be normal movies costing $10 each.  There are 400 - 160 = 240 normal movies. 

The movies in series cost 6, and since there are 200 of them, that is 200 x 6 = 1200 dollars.  The 160 older movies cost 160 x 5 = 800 dollars, and the 240 normal movies cost 240 x 10 = 2400 dollars. 

Adding up the costs, 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400.  The answer is 4400.

[EXP] 115: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Billy originally earned 10 dollars per hour.  After 2 months, he got a raise of 0. 50, so he now earns 10 + 0. 50 = 10. 50 per hour.  After his 1st anniversary, he got another raise of 1. 00 per hour, so he now earns 10. 50 + 1. 00 = 11. 50 per hour. 

Billy earns 20 * 11. 50 = 230 dollars. 

Sally starts at 10 + 0. 50 = 10. 50 per hour, so she earns 20 * 10. 50 = 210 dollars. 

The difference is 230 - 210 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
 Billy's initial rate was 10 dollars per hour.  After 2 months, he was given a raise of 0. 50 dollars per hour.  So his new rate was 10 + 0. 5 = 10. 50 dollars per hour.  After his 1st anniversary, he was given another raise of 1. 00 dollars per hour.  So his new rate was 10. 50 + 1 = 11. 50 dollars per hour. 

Sally's starting salary is 0. 50 dollars more than Billy's starting salary, which is 10 dollars.  So Sally's starting salary is 10 + 0. 50 = 10. 50 dollars. 

They both work 20 hours, so Billy earns 11. 50 * 20 = 230 dollars and Sally earns 10. 50 * 20 = 210 dollars.  The difference is 230 - 210 = 20 dollars.  The answer is 20. 
 Billy starts with a rate of $10 per hour.  $10 + $0. 50 = $10. 50, after 2 months.  $10. 50 + $1. 00 = $11. 50, on his first anniversary.  Lisa starts with $10. 50 - $0. 50, which is $10.  Billy works 20 hours, so he makes 20 x $11. 50 = $230.  Sally works 20 hours, so she makes 20 x $10. 50 = $210.  Billy makes $230 - $210 = $20 more than Sally.  The answer is 20. 
 Let's first find Billy's starting salary per hour.   Billy's starting salary was 10 dollars.   After a raise of 0. 50 dollars per hour, he earns 10. 50 dollars per hour.   After another raise of 1. 00 dollars per hour, he earns 11. 50 dollars per hour. 

Sally's starting salary is 10 + 0. 50 = 10. 50 dollars.   So Sally earns 10. 50 dollars.   When working for 20 hours, Billy earns 20 * 11. 50 = 230 dollars, and Sally earns 20 * 10. 50 = 210 dollars.   Billy earns 230 - 210 = 20 dollars more than Sally.  

The answer is 20. 
 Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour.  With a raise of $0. 50 per hour twice, his hourly salary now is 10 + 0. 5 + 1 = 11. 50.   Sally's starting salary is $10. 50 which is $0. 50 more than Billy's starting salary.  Billy's total salary after working 20 hours at this rate would be 20 * 11. 5 = 230.  Sally's total salary after working 20 hours at this rate would be 20 * 10. 5 = 210.  Billy will earn $230 - $210 = $20 more than Sally.  The answer is 20. 
 Let's break it down into parts.  

At first, Billy was paid $10 per hour.  After 2 months, his salary increased by $0. 50 per hour, so his new rate was $10. 50 per hour.  Then, on his first anniversary, his salary increased by another $1. 00 per hour, so his new rate was $11. 50 per hour.  Sally starts with a salary of $0. 50 more than Billy's starting salary.  Billy started at $10 per hour, so Sally started at $10. 50 per hour.  Since both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, Billy earns $11. 50 * 20 hours = $230. 00.  Sally earns $10. 50 * 20 hours = $210. 00.  So Billy earns $230. 00 - $210. 00 = $20. 00 more than Sally.  The answer is 20. 
 Billy was first paid 10 dollars an hour.  After 2 months, he was given a raise of 0. 5 dollars an hour.  This is 10 + 0. 5 = 10. 5.  After his first anniversary, he got another raise of 1 dollar.  This is now 10. 5 + 1 = 11. 5 dollars an hour.  Sally's starting salary is 0. 5 dollars an hour more than Billy's starting salary, which is 10.  So Sally's starting salary is 10 + 0. 5 = 10. 5.  Both Billy and Sally work 20 hours.  Billy makes 11. 5 dollars per hour.  Sally makes 10. 5 dollars per hour.  The difference is 11. 5 - 10. 5 = 1.  Billy makes 1 dollar more per hour than Sally.  If they both work for 20 hours, the difference will be 20 * 1 = 20 dollars.  The answer is 20. 
 Billy starts out at 10 dollars per hour.  He gets a 0. 50 per hour raise, so he earns 10 + 0. 50 = 10. 50 per hour.  He gets another 1. 00 per hour raise on his 1 year anniversary, so now he makes 10. 50 + 1. 00 = 11. 50 per hour.  But we need to calculate Billy's total pay for 20 hours and Sally's total pay for 20 hours.  Billy's pay will be 11. 50 * 20 = 230.

[EXP] 119: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she had 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs. 
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. 
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs. 

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27 eggs. 

The answer is 27. 
 Let's start with the number of green eggs, which is 5.  Cindy has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has 2 x 5 = 10 blue eggs.  She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  And she has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has 1/3 x 9 = 3 yellow eggs. 

To find the total number of eggs, add up the number of eggs of each color: 5 green eggs + 10 blue eggs + 9 pink eggs + 3 yellow eggs = 27 eggs.  The answer is 27. 
 Let's start by figuring out how many blue eggs Cindy had.  She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, and she had 5 green eggs.  So, she had 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs. 

She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. 

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs. 

To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we add together the number of green, blue, pink, and yellow eggs: 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27.  The answer is 27. 
 Let's start by using the information given:
- She had 5 green eggs. 
- She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs.  So, she had 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs. 
- She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. 
- She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs.  So, she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs. 

Now, let's count the total number of eggs:
- 5 green eggs
- 10 blue eggs
- 9 pink eggs
- 3 yellow eggs

Total number of eggs = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27

The answer is 27. 
5 green eggs
Blue eggs are 2 times the number of green eggs, so she has 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs. 
Pink eggs are one fewer than blue eggs, so she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. 
Yellow eggs are one-third the number of pink eggs, so she has 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs. 
In total, Cindy has 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 eggs.  5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27.  The answer is 27. 
 Let's start with the green eggs.  Cindy had 5 green eggs.  Since she has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she has 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs. 

She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. 

She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has 9 ÷ 3 = 3 yellow eggs. 

To find the total number of eggs, we can add them up: 5 green eggs, 10 blue eggs, 9 pink eggs, and 3 yellow eggs.  This gives us 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs. 

The answer is 27. 
 Let's start by finding the number of blue eggs.  Since there are twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, and Cindy has 5 green eggs, she has 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs. 

The number of pink eggs is one fewer than the number of blue eggs, so Cindy has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. 

The number of yellow eggs is one-third as many as pink eggs, so Cindy has 9 ÷ 3 = 3 yellow eggs. 

Now we can add up the total number of eggs Cindy has: 5 green eggs + 10 blue eggs + 9 pink eggs + 3 yellow eggs = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27.  The answer is 27. 
 Let's start by identifying the number of each type of egg: 
- green eggs: 5
- blue eggs: twice as many as green ones: 5 * 2 = 10
- pink eggs: one fewer than blue eggs: 10 - 1 = 9
- yellow eggs: one-third as many as pink eggs: 9 / 3 = 3 

Now, we need to find the total number of eggs.  We add them together:
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

[EXP] 120: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 1 x 12 = 12 inches.  Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 12 x 4 = 48 inches.  Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 48 x 10 = 480 inches.  Since there are 12 inches in 1 foot, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 feet.  480 / 12 is 40.  The answer is 40. 
 Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher, so Saskay can lift a mountain 1 x 12 = 12 inches.  Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 12 x 4 = 48 inches.  Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher, so Naruto can lift a mountain 48 x 10 = 480 inches.  To convert inches to feet, divide by 12.  480 ÷ 12 = 40.  The answer is 40 feet. 
 Let's solve this problem step by step:

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 

Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 x 1 = 12 inches. 

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 x 12 = 48 inches. 

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 x 48 = 480 inches. 

There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 480 inches is equal to 480 ÷ 12 = 40 feet. 

The answer is 40 feet. 
 We know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches.  Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 12 x 4 = 48 inches = 4 feet.  Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 x 4 = 40 feet. 

The answer is 40. 
 If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12 x 1 = 12 inches.   Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 x 12 = 48 inches.   Naruto can lift a mountain 10 x 48 = 480 inches.  There are 12 inches in a foot, so 480 / 12 = 40 feet.  The answer is 40. 
 Since Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 x 1 = 12 inches.  Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 12 x 4 = 48 inches.  Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 x 48 = 480 inches.  To convert inches to feet, divide 480 by 12, since there are 12 inches in a foot.  480 / 12 = 40.  The answer is 40 feet. 
 Let's break it down step by step:

Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 x 1 inch = 12 inches. 

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 x 12 inches = 48 inches. 

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 x 48 inches = 480 inches. 

Since there are 12 inches in 1 foot, we can convert Naruto's height from inches to feet:

480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet

So Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.  The answer is 40 feet. 
 Let's break it down step by step.  Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so she can lift 1 x 12 = 12 inches. 

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so she can lift 12 x 4 = 48 inches. 

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so he can lift 48 x 10 = 480 inches. 

To convert inches to feet, we divide the number of inches by 12.  480 ÷ 12 = 40.  The answer is 40. 
 Papa sengoku is a waki flight of higher silica eggs.

[EXP] 121: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's calculate the unused length of each glue stick:

1.  The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which means 5/6 is used.  Since the original length is 12 millimeters, the used length is 5/6 * 12 = 10 millimeters.  The unused length is 12 - 10 = 2 millimeters. 

2.  The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which means 1/3 is used.  Since the original length is 12 millimeters, the used length is 1/3 * 12 = 4 millimeters.  The unused length is 12 - 4 = 8 millimeters. 

3.  The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which means 1/2 is used.  Since the original length is 12 millimeters, the used length is 1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters.  The unused length is 12 - 6 = 6 millimeters. 

To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we add up the unused lengths:

2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm

The answer is 16 millimeters. 
 Let's calculate the length of glue sticks not used.  The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which means 1/6 * 12 = 2 mm left.  The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which means 2/3 * 12 = 8 mm left.  The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which means 1/2 * 12 = 6 mm left.  Total length of glue sticks not used = 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 mm.  The answer is 16. 
12 x 1/6 = 2 mm left in the first glue stick.  12 x 2/3 = 8 mm left in the second glue stick.  12 x 1/2 = 6 mm left in the third glue stick.  The total amount of glue that hasn't been used is the sum of these amounts: 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 mm.  The answer is 16. 
 First, find how much glue stick is left unused.  The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which means it is 1/6 * 12 = 2 mm left.  The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which means it is 2/3 * 12 = 8 mm left.  The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which means it is 1/2 * 12 = 6 mm left.  Total length of glue that is not used is 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 mm.  The answer is 16. 
 To solve this problem, I will first calculate the length of each glue stick that is remaining.  Then I will add them up. 

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the length remaining is 1/6 * 12 mm = 2 mm. 

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the length remaining is 2/3 * 12 mm = 8 mm. 

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the length remaining is 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm. 

To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, I will add up the lengths of the remaining parts: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm

The answer is 16 mm.

After two years, she will have 525 + (3/4) * 525 = 525 + 393. 75 = 918. 75 dollars.  After three years, she will have 918. 75 + (3/4) * 918. 75 = 918. 75 + 274. 31 = 1193. 06 dollars.  The answer is 1193. 
 Brenda invested 300 dollars.  After one year, she will have earned 3/4 of 300 = 225 dollars, so she will have 300 + 225 = 525 dollars.  In the second year, she will earn 3/4 of 525 = 393. 75 dollars.  So she will have 525 + 393. 75 = 918. 75 dollars.  In the third year, she will earn 3/4 of 918. 75 = 274. 69.  So she will have 918. 75 + 274. 69 = 1193. 44.  The answer is 1193. 44. 
300 dollars is the original amount.  Brenda gets 3/4 of the original amount each year.  3/4 of 300 is 225.  After the first year, she has 300 + 225 = 525.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes. 

In the next year, they will build 3 times this many, which is 12 x 3 = 36 homes. 

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built so far.  To find the total number of homes built so far, add the number of homes built in the first two years: 12 + 36 = 48. 

Doubling this number gives 48 x 2 = 96. 

In total, the town will have built 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes over the next three years.  The answer is 144.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes. 

In the second year, they will build three times this many homes, which is:
12 x 3 = 36 homes

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes they've built so far, which is:
12 + 36 = 48 homes, doubled is 48 x 2 = 96 homes

To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we add the number of homes built each year:
12 + 36 + 96 = 144

The answer is 144. 
 Let's break it down step by step!

In the first year, they will build 12 homes. 

In the next year, they will build three times as many homes, so 12 x 3 = 36 homes. 

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built, which is 12 + 36 = 48.  Doubling that gives 48 x 2 = 96. 

To find the total number of homes built over the three years, add them up:

12 + 36 + 96 = 144

The answer is 144. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Year 1: The town will build 12 homes. 

Year 2: The town will build three times this many homes, which is 12 x 3 = 36 homes. 

Year 3: The town will build 2 times the total number of homes they've built so far.  To find the total number of homes, we add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 = 48.  Doubling this number gives us 48 x 2 = 96. 

To find the total number of homes built over the 3 years, we add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144. 

The answer is 144. 
 The town will start by building 12 homes in the first year.  Then, the next year, they will build 3 * 12 = 36 homes.  Then, in the third year, they will build double the amount of homes they have built so far.  The total amount of homes built so far is 12 + 36 = 48.  Double that amount is 48 * 2 = 96.  So in the third year, they will build 96 homes.  The total amount of homes built over the next three years is the sum of the number of homes built each year, which is 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.  The answer is 144. 
 The town is going to build homes across the next three years. 

In the first year, they are going to build 12 homes. 

In the next year, they will build three times 12 homes.  3 * 12 = 36 homes will be built in the second year. 

In the third year, they will double the number of homes they built over the previous two years.  So they will double 12 + 36 = 48 homes.  2 * 48 is 96 homes. 

So the total number of homes built is 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.  The answer is 144. 
 The town is building 12 homes in the first year, which is 12.  Then they build 3 times this number in the second year, which is 12 * 3 = 36.  In the third year, they double the total amount, so they add 12 + 36 = 48, then double that to 96.  Finally, we add up the amount of homes built each year, which is 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The 7 packs of apples cost 7 * 2 = 14 dollars.  In total, 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 dollars.  Kelly started with a budget of 65 dollars and spent 60 dollars, so she has 65 - 60 = 5 dollars left.  The answer is 5. 
 Kelly has 65 dollars in her budget.  First, she purchased 5 packs of bacon, which cost 10 dollars.  Then, she purchased 6 packets of chicken, which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon.  Since a pack of bacon is 10 / 5 = 2 dollars, a packet of chicken costs 2 x 2 = 4 dollars.  So the total cost of the chicken is 6 x 4 = 24 dollars.  Then, she purchased 3 packs of strawberries, priced at 4 dollars each, which is 3 x 4 = 12 dollars.  Finally, she purchased 7 packs of apples, priced at half the price of a strawberry, which is 7 x (4 / 2) = 7 x 2 = 14 dollars.  So the total amount of money she spends is 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 dollars.  If she started with 65 dollars and spent 60 dollars, she has 65 - 60 = 5 dollars left.  The answer is 5. 
5 packs of bacon cost $10, so each pack of bacon costs $2.  Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, each costing twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs $4 (2 * 2).  Since 6 packets of chicken cost 6 * 4 = 24 dollars, and 5 packs of bacon cost 10 dollars, she has spent 10 + 24 = 34 dollars on the meats.  She also got 3 packs of strawberries, costing 4 dollars each, so she has spent 3 * 4 = 12 dollars on strawberries.  Finally, she got 7 packs of apples, costing half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is 4/2 = 2 dollars.  So she has spent 7 * 2 = 14 dollars on apples.

200 is the number of acres that Farmer Brown's farm has.  Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that amount.  So, twice 200 is 200 * 2 = 400, and 100 more than that is 400 + 100 = 500.  Originally, there were 200 acres from Farmer Brown's farm and 500 acres from Farmer Smith's farm.  So, the total number of acres is 200 + 500 = 700.  The answer is 700. 
 Let's break down the problem:

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that.  To find out how many acres it is, we need to multiply the area of Farmer Brown's farm by 2:

200 acres x 2 = 400 acres

Then, add 100 acres:

400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres

Now, let's find the total number of acres for both farms together:

Farmer Brown's farm: 200 acres
Farmer Smith's farm: 500 acres
Total acres: 200 acres + 500 acres = 700 acres

The answer is 700. 
 If Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm, that means it is 2x + 100 acres, where x is the size of Farmer Brown's farm.  Since x is 200, we plug in 200 for x and get 2x + 100 = 2(200) + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500.  The size of Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres and the size of Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.  Together, they have 200 + 500 = 700.  The answer is 700. 
200 acres is Farmer Brown's farm.  Since Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that, first we need to calculate what that is.  Twice 200 is 400.  Then add 100 to that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500.  We need to find the total of these two farms.  200 acres is Farmer Brown's farm, and 500 acres is Farmer Smith's farm.  So, 200 + 500 = 700.

[EXP] 133: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 24 berries in 8 hours.  In 4 hours, he would pick up 24/2 = 12 berries.  Since he makes 8/4 = 2 trips, the answer is 12 berries per trip. 
 The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.  Since he spends 4 hours per trip, the number of trips will be 8 / 4 = 2 trips.  To find the least number of berries he can pick up per trip, we need to divide 24 by 2.  24 divided by 2 is 12.  The answer is 12. 
24 berries in 8 hours is the same as 24 / 8 = 3 berries per hour.  Since it takes the sloth 4 hours for each trip to the ground, the sloth can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.  To find least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we can divide 24 berries by 2 trips.  24 / 2 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
 The sloth eats when he is up in his tree.  It takes the sloth 4 hours for a meal.  In 8 hours, the sloth will go 8/4 = 2 times for a meal.  He needs to collect 24 berries.  On each trip, he can pick up 24/2 = 12 berries (since he goes 2 times for a meal).  The answer is 12. 
24 berries have to be picked in 8 hours.  Since the sloth spends 4 hours on a trip down the tree, picking up berries, and climbing back up the tree, 8 hours are for 2 trips.  The number of berries per trip would be 24 / 2 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
24 berries in 8 hours means that the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.  Each trip takes 4 hours, so the least number of trips the sloth can make is 8 / 4 = 2.  Now, we need to find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.  If he picks 12 berries per trip, that is 2 trips for 24 berries.  The answer is 12. 
4 hours is how long it takes to make the trip down, pick up berries, and climb back up.  Let x be the number of berries he picks on each trip.  So in 8 hours, he can pick up a total of 2 x berries (because he makes 2 trips in 8 hours).  2x = 24, and x = 12.  The sloth picks up 12 berries per trip. 

The answer is 12. 
24 berries is the number of berries he wants to collect in 8 hours.  Let's first convert the 8 hours into how many trips he'll take.  Since it takes him 4 hours to make one trip, 8 hours is equivalent to 8 / 4 = 2 trips.  He will make 2 trips to pick the berries.  

Now, let's first calculate how many berries he can collect in one trip.  The equation will be:

 berries per trip = berries collected / total number of trips

Since the total number of trips is 2, the berries per trip = 24 / 2 = 12

So, the sloth must collect at least 12 berries on each trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.  The answer is 12. 
 Let's break down the time the sloth has to collect berries.  He can spend most of his time (24 hours - 8 hours = 16 hours) on other activities.  The other 8 hours, he is available to collect berries. 

Since each trip down the tree and back up takes 4 hours, the sloth can make 8/4 = 2 trips per day.  In each trip, he collects the same number of berries, call it x.  The total number of berries is 24. 

We know that 2x = 24.  To get the least number of berries, we subtract 2 from both sides: 2x - 2 = 24 - 2.  2x - 2 = 22.  Then, add 2 to both sides: 2x = 22 + 2.  2x = 24.  Divide both sides by 2: x = 12. 

The sloth can pick up at least 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.  The answer is 12.

[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's say Jean's age is x.  Then Paul's age is x + 10, because Paul is 10 years older than Jean.  We know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, so Peter's age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10. 

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100, so we can set up the equation:
x + (x + 10) + (2x + 10) = 100

Combine like terms:
4x + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4x = 80

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 20

So Jean's age is 20.  Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, so Peter's age is 20 + 20 + 10 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step.  We know that Paul's age is 10 years older than John's age.  Let's say John's age is x.  Then Paul's age is x + 10. 

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.  So Peter's age is (x + 10) + x.  We can simplify this expression to 2x + 10. 

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old.  We can set up an equation using this information:

(x + 10) + x + (2x + 10) = 100

Combine like terms:

4x + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4x = 80

Divide by 4:

x = 20

So John's age is 20 years old.  Since Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul's age is 20 + 10 = 30. 

Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age, which is 20 + 30 = 50. 

The answer is 50. 
 Let's say Jean's age is x. 
Since Paul is 10 years older than Jean, Paul's age is x+10. 
We know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, which is (x+10) + x = 2x + 10. 
The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100, so x + (x+10) + 2x + 10 = 100. 
Combine like terms: 4x + 20 = 100. 
Subtract 20 from both sides: 4x = 80. 
Divide both sides by 4: x = 20. 
So Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, which is 2x + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50. 
The answer is 50. 
 Let's call John's age "J".  Since Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul's age is J + 10.  The combined age is 100, so J + J + 10 + Peter's age equals 100. 

We know that Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age = J + (J + 10) = 2J + 10. 

Putting the two expressions together, we get:
J + J + 10 + 2J + 10 = 100

Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

So John's age is 20.  Paul's age is J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.  Since Peter's age is 2J + 10, Peter's age is 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50. 

The answer is 50. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

We know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages, and we can write an equation to represent this: P = P + J

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so we can write another equation: P - J = 10

We can simplify the first equation by subtracting J from both sides: P - J = P

Since P - J = 10, we can substitute this into the simplified equation: P - 10 = P

Subtracting P from both sides gives us: -10 = 0

This doesn't make sense, so let's look at our equations again.  We can try rearranging the second equation to isolate P: P = J + 10

Substituting this into the first equation gives us: P = P + (P + 10)

Combining like terms gives us: P = 2P + 10

Subtracting 2P from both sides gives us: -P = 10

Dividing both sides by -1 gives us: P = -10

But this can't be correct, since age can't be negative! There must be an error in our equations.  Let's re-examine the problem. 

Looking again at the problem, we see that we know Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages, and Paul is 10 years older than Jean.  Let's try rewriting the equation for Peter's age in terms of Jean's age: P = J + (J + 10)

Simplifying this equation gives us: P = 2J + 10

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100, so we can set up an equation: P + P + J = 100

Substituting P = 2J + 10 into this equation, we get: (2J + 10) + (2J + 10) + J = 100

Combining like terms and solving for J, we get: J = 20

Now we can find Peter's age by substituting J into the equation for P: P = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50

The answer is 50.

4.  He wants to buy 5 pencils for 10 dollars each, so that's 5 x 10 = 50 dollars.  After buying the pencils, he has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left. 

5.  Each pen costs 25 dollars.  So he can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens. 
The answer is 4. 
 Firstly, calculate John's total earnings:

50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

Then, calculate how much John has left after spending 50 dollars on gas:

300 - 50 = 250 dollars

Then, calculate how much John has left after depositing 100 dollars in the bank:

250 - 100 = 150 dollars

John has 150 dollars left.  He wants to buy pens that cost 25 dollars each.  To find out how many pens he can buy, divide his remaining money by the cost of one pen:

150 dollars / 25 dollars = 6

John has enough money to buy 6 pens. 

Since John also wants to buy pencils that cost 10 dollars each, and he bought 5 pencils, calculate the total cost of the pencils:

5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Subtract the cost of the pencils from John's remaining money:

150 dollars - 50 dollars = 100 dollars

John has 100 dollars left after buying the pencils.  Now he is left with

In total, it took him 6 hours to swim 12 miles, 3 hours resting, and 8 hours to swim the remaining 8 miles.  In total, it took him 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.  The answer is 17. 
 James has to swim across a 20-mile lake.  He swims 20 * 0. 6 = 12 miles.  He swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.  So it took him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours to swim 12 miles.

After resting, he still needs to swim the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.  He swam this distance at half the original speed, which is 1 mile per hour.  So it took him 8 hours to swim the remaining distance. 

Adding up the three parts, it took James 6 hours to swim 12 miles, 3 hours to rest, and 8 hours to swim the remaining distance, for a total of 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.  The answer is 17. 
 James started with swimming at 2 miles per hour to swim 20 miles.  60% of the distance is 20 * 0. 6 = 12 miles, so he swam 12 miles.  2 miles per hour means it took him 12/2 = 6 hours to swim 12 miles.  Then, he rested for half of that time, which is 6/2 = 3 hours.  Now, he has 20 - 12 = 8 miles left.  He swims at half of the speed, which is 2/2 = 1 mile per hour, so it takes him 8 hours to finish the remaining distance.  6 hours to swim the first part and 3 hours to rest add up to 9 hours.  Then it takes another 8 hours to finish.  The total time is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.  The answer is 17. 
 James starts with a 20-mile lake to swim.  He swims 60% of the distance, which is 0. 60 * 20 = 12 miles.  He swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.  So it takes him 12 / 2 = 6 hours to swim that 12 miles. 

After that, he swims for half as long again, which is half of 6 hours, or 3 hours. 

James only has 20 - 12 = 8 miles left to swim.  He speeds up to half his original pace, or 1 mile per hour.  He needs 8 hours to finish the remaining 8 miles at that pace.

 Tobias' howl is 20 seconds long.  Chikote's howl is twice as long, so 2 x 20 = 40 seconds long.  Igneous' howl is the same as the total of the other two, so 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  The total length is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.  To convert this to minutes, divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2.  The answer is 2. 
 Let's break it down:

Tobias howls for 20 seconds, or 20/60 = 1/3 minutes. 

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2/3 minutes. 

The total time Tobias and Chikote howl is 1/3 + 2/3 = 3/3 = 1 minute. 

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  The other two wolves combined howl for 1 minute, so Igneous howls for 1 minute. 

In total, the three wolves howl for 1 + 1 = 2 minutes. 

The answer is 2. 
3 wolves

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.  Chikote howls for twice as long, so that is 2 × 20 = 40 seconds.  Igneous howls for as long as the other two combined, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  So the combined length of their howls is 20 + 40 + 60 seconds = 120 seconds. 

  120 seconds = 120 / 60 = 2 minutes

The answer is 2. 
 First, we find out how many seconds each wolf howls for.  Tobias howls for 20 seconds.  Chikote howls for twice as long, so he howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds.  Then, Igneous howls for as long as the other two together, so he howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds. 

Now, we have to convert these seconds to minutes.  There are 60 seconds in a minute.  20 seconds is 20 / 60 = 1/3 of a minute.  40 seconds is 40 / 60 = 2/3 of a minute.  60 seconds is 60 / 60 = 1 minute. 

The wolves howl for 1/3 + 2/3 + 1 = 2 minutes in total.  The answer is 2. 
 Let's start by figuring out the length of Chikote's howl.  Since Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, and Tobias howls for 20 seconds, Chikote's howl lasts for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.  Then, let's find out the length of Igneous' howl.  Igneous' howl is as long as the combined howls of Tobias and Chikote.  So we need to add the length of Tobias' howl to the length of Chikote's howl.  This gives us 20 + 40 = 60 seconds for Igneous.  To find the combined length of their howls, we add the three lengths together: 20 (Tobias) + 40 (Chikote) + 60 (Igneous) = 120 seconds.  Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert the total length to minutes by dividing by 60: 120 ÷ 60 = 2.  The answer is 2. 
 First, we know Tobias howls for 20 seconds.  Chikote howls for twice as long, so she howls for 20 * 2 = 40 seconds.  Igneous and the other two wolves combined howl for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  We need to add Igneous' howl time to this, but we don't know how long that is yet.  Say the other two combined for 60 seconds, that means Igneous howls for the same amount, 60 seconds.  So the total time for all the wolves is 20 + 40 + 60 seconds, which is 120 seconds.  This is 120 seconds or 2 minutes.  The answer is 2.

To find the combined length of their howls, we add the three lengths together: 20 (Tobias) + 40 (Chikote) + 60 (Igneous) = 120 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long, so she howls for 20 * 2 = 40 seconds.  Igneous and the other two wolves combined howl for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  We need to add Igneous' howl time to this, but we don't know how long that is yet.  Say the other two combined for 60 seconds, that means Igneous howls for the same amount, 60 seconds.  So the total time for all the wolves is 20 + 40 + 60 seconds, which is 120 seconds.  This is 120 seconds or 2 minutes.  The answer is 2. "]
[EXP] 144: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Jordan needs 20 minutes to make the cake batter, 30 minutes to bake the cake, 2 hours to cool the cake, and 10 minutes to frost the cake.   That is a total of 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes or 3 hours.  3 hours before 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.  The answer is 2:00 pm. 
 Let's break down the time needed for each step:

* Making cake batter: 20 minutes
* Baking cake: 30 minutes
* Cooling cake: 2 hours
* Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time needed: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours.  5:00 pm is the target time to serve the cake.  So, we need to subtract the total time needed from 5:00 pm:

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Jordan should start making the cake at 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.  The answer is 2:00 pm. 
20 minutes to make the cake batter and 30 minutes to bake the cake is 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.  Then, it takes 2 hours to cool, which is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes = 2 hours.  Finally, 10 minutes to frost.  So in total, it takes 50 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.  180 minutes is equal to 180 / 60 = 3 hours.  If Jordan wants to be done by 5:00 pm, she should start making the cake by 5:00 - 3 = 2:00 pm.  The answer is 2:00 pm. 
20 minutes to make the cake batter and 30 minutes to bake the cake adds up to 50 minutes for making and baking the cake.  Then it will take 2 hours to cool the cake.  So 50 minutes + 2 hours = 2 hours 50 minutes.  Then, an additional 10 minutes to frost the cake.  2 hours 50 minutes + 10 minutes = 3 hours.  It will take a total of 3 hours.  To start making the cake at 5:00 pm, we have to start making it 3 hours earlier than that.  5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.  The answer is 2:00 pm. 
 Let's add up the time required for making the cake batter, baking the cake, and cooling the cake.  The steps for making the cake take 20 + 30 + 120 = 170 minutes.  Then, after the cake is cooled, it takes 10 more minutes to frost it.  So the total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.  180 minutes is 3 hours.  Jordan can start making the cake at the latest 2:00 pm to be done by 5:00 pm.  The answer is 2:00 pm.

[EXP] 147: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Let's say Teresa sold x small stuffed animals.  Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold (1/2) x large stuffed animals. 

The price of a small stuffed animal is $4, so the revenue from the sales of small stuffed animals is 4x. 

The price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, which is 3 * 4 = 12.  So the revenue from the sales of large stuffed animals is 12(1/2)x = 6x. 

The total revenue is $120, so we set up the equation:

4x + 6x = 120

Combine like terms:

10x = 120

Divide both sides by 10:

x = 12

So Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.  The answer is 12. 
 Let's start by figuring out how much each large stuffed animal costs.  If Teresa sells them for three times the price of small stuffed animals, and each small stuffed animal costs $4, then large stuffed animals cost 4 x 3 = $12 each. 

She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so let's call the number of large stuffed animals x.  Then the number of small stuffed animals is 2x. 

She earned $120 from the sales.  We can set up an equation to represent this:

12x + 4(2x) = 120

Combine like terms:

12x + 8x = 120

Multiply both sides by 1 to get:

20x = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 6

So Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals.  Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals, she sold 2x = 2(6) = 12 small stuffed animals. 

The answer is 12. 
 Let the number of large stuffed animals sold be x.  Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x. 
Small stuffed animals are sold at $4 each, so the total amount earned from small stuffed animals is 2x \* 4 = 8x. 
Since large stuffed animals are sold for three times the price of small ones, each large stuffed animal is sold for $4 \* 3 = $12.  The total amount earned from large stuffed animals is x \* 12 = 12x. 
The total amount earned is $120, so the equation is: 8x + 12x = 120. 
Combine like terms: 20x = 120. 
Divide by 20: x = 6. 
So Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals.  She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so she sold 2x = 2 \* 6 = 12 small stuffed animals. 
The answer is 12. 
 Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones.  So if a small one costs $4, a large one costs 4 x 3 = $12. 

Then, she sold twice as many small ones as large ones, so let's say she sold x large ones and 2x small ones. 

The total amount of money earned is $120.  She earns $4 from each small stuffed animal, so from the small ones she earns 4 x 2x = $8x.  She earns $12 from each large stuffed animal, so from the large ones she earns 12 x x = 12x.  The total amount of money earned is the sum of these, which is 8x + 12x = 20x. 

We know the total amount earned is $120, so 20x = 120.  To find x, we can divide both sides by 20, which gives us x = 6. 

This means she sold 6 large stuffed animals, and 2x = 2(6) = 12 small stuffed animals.  The answer is 12. 
 Let's break this down step by step.  Since Teresa earned 120 dollars from the sales, we can start by using that information.  Let's say the number of small stuffed animals sold is S and the number of large stuffed animals sold is L.  

We are told that Teresa earned 120 dollars, so we can set up an equation:

4S + 12L = 120

We are also told that each small stuffed animal costs 4 dollars, and each large stuffed animal costs 3 times the price of the small ones, which means they cost 12 dollars each.  The number of large stuffed animals sold is L, so the total amount earned from large stuffed animals is 12L. 

We are also given that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so S = 2L.  

We can substitute this into the first equation:

4(2L) + 12L = 120

Combine like terms:

8L + 12L = 120

Combine the constants:

20L = 120

Now divide both sides by 20:

L = 6

So Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals.  Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, we can multiply by 2 to get the number of small stuffed animals:

S = 2L = 2(6) = 12

The answer is 12. 
 First, find the cost of large stuffed animals.  Small stuffed animals cost 4 dollars each and she sells that for triple, so large stuffed animals cost 3*4 = 12 dollars.  She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so let's start by setting up an equation:

Let n be the number of large stuffed animals sold. 
Let 2n be the number of small stuffed animals sold. 
Each large stuffed animal costs 12 dollars, so she earned 12*n dollars from large stuffed animals. 
Each small stuffed animal costs 4 dollars and she sold 2*n of them, so she earned 4*2*n = 8*n dollars from small stuffed animals. 
The total amount earned is the sum of the earnings from large and small stuffed animals: 12*n + 8*n = 20*n. 
The total amount earned is 120 dollars, so 20*n = 120. 
To solve for n, we can divide both sides by 20: n = 120/20 = 6. 
So she sold 6 large stuffed animals. 
She sold twice as many small as large, so she sold 6*2 = 12 small stuffed animals. 

The answer is 12.

[EXP] 154: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 251, [output]:  Let's first find the total number of guests.  Kayla has 25 classmates, 7 dance class girls, and 13 family members.  That's a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45.  However, 4 people cannot attend, so the effective number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.  The fee for 20 guests is 125 dollars.  The extra 21 guests cost 6 dollars each, so that's 21 x 6 = 126 dollars.  The total fee is 125 + 126 = 251 dollars.  The answer is 251. 
 First, let's find out how many guests will attend the party.  Kayla invited her classmates, 25 - 4 = 21, and 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members.  So there will be a total of 21 + 7 + 13 = 41 guests.  The base fee for the party is $125.  However, there will be 41 - 20 = 21 guests above the base number of 20.  Each of these 21 guests will cost $6, so the additional fee will be 21 * 6 = 126 dollars.  The total fee will be the base fee plus the additional fee, which is 125 + 126 = 251 dollars.  The answer is 251. 
 Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 dance class girls, and 13 family members.  In total, that's 25 + 7 + 13 = 45.  Subtracting the 4 who couldn't come, that's 45 - 4 = 41.  The party is $125 for 20 and $6 for each additional guest.  For the first 20, it's a flat rate of $125.  For the 21 (41 - 20 = 21) additional guests, it's 21 x 6 = 126.  So the total is 125 + 126 = 251.  The answer is 251. 
20 is the base cost, then there are 25 classmates + 7 girls in her dance class + 13 family members = 45.  So there are 45 - 4 = 41 people coming to the party.  That's 41 - 20 = 21 people above the base, for a cost of 6 dollars each.  So that's 6 x 21 = 126.  Adding 126 to the base of 125, we get 125 + 126 = 251.  The answer is 251. 
 Kayla is having a party at the movie theater.  The base fee is 125 dollars.  Additional guests are charged 6 dollars each.  Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls in her dance class, and 13 family members.  So, in total she has 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.  However, only 4 guests could not come.  So, there will be 45 - 4 = 41 guests.  The base fee is 125 dollars and 41-20 = 21 additional guests.  So the additional fee will be 21 x 6 = 126 dollars.  In total, the party will cost 125 + 126 = 251 dollars.  The answer is 251. 
 First, we need to calculate the total number of guests.  Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class friends + 13 family members = 45 total guests.  Since 4 couldn't attend, there will be 45 - 4 = 41 actual guests. 

The total cost will be the base fee for the party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest, until 41.  

$125 + (41 - 20) x 6 = 125 + 21 x 6 = 125 + 126 = 251

The answer is 251. 
 Kayla started by calculating the base fee for 20 people, which is 125.  Then, she calculated the additional guests: 25 classmates, 7 girls in her dance class, and 13 family members, for a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.  Since 4 people could not come, only 45 - 4 = 41 guests actually came.  The fee for additional guests is 6 dollars each, so she will be charged 6 * 21 dollars (41 - 20 guests) = 126.  The total fee is 125 (base fee) + 126 (additional guests fee) = 251 dollars.  The answer is 251. 
 First, we need to find the number of guests that attended the party.  Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 dance class girls, and 13 family members, for a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45.  However, 4 said they could not come, so the actual number of guests was 45 - 4 = 41.  Since the standard fee for 20 people is 125, there will be a fee of 125 for the standard number of guests, and then there will be an additional fee per each of the 21 extra guests (41 total minus 20 standard).  Since the additional fee is $6 per guest, we multiply 6 by 21 to get the total additional fee, which is 6 x 21 = 126.  The total cost of the party is the standard fee plus the additional fee: 125 + 126 = 251.  The answer is 251. 
 Originally, the fee was for 20 people.  The only people Kayla invited were 25 classmates, 7 dance class friends, and 13 family members.  In total, that is 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people, minus the 4 who said they could not come.  So, there are actually 45 - 4 = 41 people attending.  We need to know the fee for the first 20 people, then the extra 21 people.  The fee is $6 for each extra guest.  For 21 guests, that would be 6 x 21 = 126 dollars.  The original fee was 125 dollars, so the total fee for 41 people would be 125 + 126.  125 + 126 is 251.  The answer is 251.

[EXP] 157: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1080, [output]: 270 kilograms were left, but before that half of the triceratops was eaten, so we need to double 270 to find out how much was left after the Tyrannosaurus rex ate half.  270 * 2 is 540 kilograms.  Before that, half of the triceratops was eaten, so we need to double 540 to find out how much was the whole triceratops.  540 * 2 is 1080.  The answer is 1080. 
270 kg is what was left after the velociraptors and the Allosaurus.  Before the velociraptors, half of what the T-Rex left was eaten.  So the velociraptors got 270 / 2 = 135 kg.  Before that, the T-Rex left half of the triceratops.  So the T-Rex ate half of what was left.  That means the T-Rex ate 2 * 135 = 270 kg.  So the triceratops must have been 4 times that, or 4 * 270 = 1080 kg.  The answer is 1080. 
 A Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of a small triceratops, which left half.  Then velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, so they took half of the half, so the remaining part is 1/4 of the original.  This part is 270 kilograms.  

Let's name the original amount X.  Then 1/4*X = 270.  We can multiply both sides by 4 to get X = 270 * 4 = 1080. 

The answer is 1080. 
270 is the final amount of meat left after the T-Rex, velociraptors, and Allosaurus.  The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, so they ate (1/2) * "amount of meat after T-Rex ate".  After they ate, 270 was left, so (1/2) * ("amount of meat after T-Rex ate") = 270.  To find "amount of meat after T-Rex ate", we divide by (1/2): 270 * (2/1) = 540.  The T-Rex ate half the triceratops, so it ate (1/2) * "total amount of meat on triceratops".  So, "total amount of meat on triceratops" = 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.  The answer is 1080.

[EXP] 158: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  The first slide is 300 feet long.  If people slide down at 60 feet/minute, it will take 300 / 60 = 5 minutes to ride the first slide.  The second slide is 240 feet long.  If people slide down at 80 feet/minute, it will take 240 / 80 = 3 minutes to ride the second slide.  The difference is 5 - 3 = 2.  The answer is 2. 
 The biggest slide is 300 feet long.  People slide down at 60 feet/minute.  To go down the slide, you need 300 / 60 = 5 minutes. 

The second biggest slide is 240 feet long.  People slide down at 80 feet/minute.  To go down the slide, you need 240 / 80 = 3 minutes. 

The difference is 5 - 3 = 2 minutes.  The answer is 2. 
 Let's first calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
Speed = 60 feet/minute
Distance = 300 feet
Time = Distance / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide:
Speed = 80 feet/minute
Distance = 240 feet
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, subtract the time taken for the second biggest slide from the time taken for the biggest slide:
Time difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.  The answer is 2. 
 Let's calculate the time it takes to ride each slide. 

Biggest slide (300 ft at 60 ft/min):
Time = Distance / Speed = 300 ft / 60 ft/min = 5 min

Second biggest slide (240 ft at 80 ft/min):
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 ft / 80 ft/min = 3 min

To find the difference in time:
Biggest slide time - Second biggest slide time = 5 min - 3 min = 2 min

The answer is 2 minutes. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

The biggest waterslide is 300 feet long and people slide down at 60 feet per minute.  To find the time it takes to ride this slide, we can divide the length of the slide by the speed:

300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

So, it takes 5 minutes to ride the biggest waterslide. 

The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long and people slide down at 80 feet/minute.  To find the time it takes to ride this slide, we can divide the length of the slide by the speed:

240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

So, it takes 3 minutes to ride the second biggest waterslide. 

To find how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we subtract the time it takes to ride the second slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:

5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The answer is 2 minutes. 
1.  First, let's find the time it takes to slide down the biggest waterslide.  300 feet / 60 ft/minute = 5 minutes. 

2.  Then, let's find the time it takes to slide down the second biggest waterslide.  240 feet / 80 ft/minute = 3 minutes. 

3.  Finally, let's find the difference in the time.  5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes. 

The answer is 2 minutes. 
 The biggest slide is 300 feet long and people slide down at 60 feet/minute.  At this rate, it will take 300/60 = 5 minutes to ride the slide.  The second slide is 240 feet long.  At 80 feet/minute, it will take 240/80 = 3 minutes to ride.  So the biggest slide takes 5 - 3 = 2 minutes more.  The answer is 2. 
 The people slide down the 300 ft.  slide at a rate of 60 ft per minute, so it will take 300 / 60 = 5 minutes to slide.  The people slide down the 240 ft.  slide at a rate of 80 ft per minute, so it will take 240 / 80 = 3 minutes to slide.  The answer is 2.

The answer is 280. 
 Since John visits his parents twice a month, he will make 2 round trips.  A round trip is 2 x distance, and since it's a one-way trip, it's 2 hours at 70 mph, which means the distance is 70 x 2 = 140 miles.  So for 2 round trips, it will be 140 x 2 = 280 miles.  The answer is 280. 
 There are two trips, so we need to calculate the distance for one trip and then multiply it by 2.  For one trip, John will drive for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.  So he will drive 2 * 70 = 140 miles.  As it's a round trip, he will drive 140 * 2 = 280 miles per month.  The answer is 280. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

First, the round trip, from John's home to his parents' home and back, takes 2 hours.  If it takes him 2 hours to drive at a speed of 70 mph, we can calculate the distance:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 * 2 = 140 miles

So the round trip distance is 140 miles. 

John visits his parents twice a month, so he does the round trip twice a month.  To find the total distance he drives in a month, we multiply the round trip distance by 2:

Total distance = Round trip distance * 2
Total distance = 140 * 2 = 280 miles

The answer is 280. 
 John goes to his parents twice a month, so he makes two round trips.  It takes him 2 hours to drive there and back, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours.  4 hours * 70 mph is 280 miles.  This is the distance for two round trips, so one round trip is half this distance, which is 140 miles.  since he does this twice a month, the total distance is 2 * 140 = 280 miles.  The answer is 280. 
 Voted result: [' John visits his parents twice a month, so he makes 2 round trips.  Each round trip is 2 x 70 = 140 miles.  Since he makes 2 round trips per month, that is 2 x 140 = 280 miles.

 Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days.  That is 30 x 3 = 90 eggs.  After that, he eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days.  That is 30 x 5 = 150 eggs.  So in total, he ate 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.  To find the number of dozens, we can divide 240 by 12 (because there are 12 eggs in a dozen).  240 / 12 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
30 days of 3 eggs a day = 3 x 30 = 90 eggs.  30 days of 5 eggs a day = 5 x 30 = 150 eggs.  In total, Chester will need 90 + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.  Since a dozen eggs is 12 eggs, the total number of dozens needed is 240 / 12 = 20 dozens.  The answer is 20. 
30 days at 3 eggs per day is 3 x 30 = 90 eggs.  Then he increased to 5 eggs per day for 30 days.  30 days at 5 eggs per day is 5 x 30 = 150 eggs.  So in total, Chester will eat 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.  240 eggs is 20 dozens.  The answer is 20. 
 Let's break it down into two parts.  First, Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days.  That's 3 x 30 = 90 eggs.  Second, he eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days.  That's 5 x 30 = 150 eggs.  In total, he eats 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.  A dozen eggs is 12 eggs, so we need to find how many dozens of eggs is 240.  240 / 12 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
1 dozen is 12 eggs.  We need to find out how many eggs Chester eats in total for 60 days. 

First, Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days.  So he eats 3 x 30 = 90 eggs. 

After that, Chester eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days.  So he eats 5 x 30 = 150 eggs. 

To find the total number of eggs Chester eats for 60 days, add the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and in the second 30 days: 90 + 150 = 240 eggs. 

To find the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs, divide the total number of eggs by 12: 240 ÷ 12 = 20. 

So the answer is 20 dozens. 
 We will solve this problem step by step.  

Initially, Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days.  So he will eat 3 * 30 = 90 eggs in the first phase.  Then, he eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days.  So he will eat 5 * 30 = 150 eggs in the second phase.

Since Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount to their little sister, Ronnie also gave 3 dollars.  Ronnie had 5 dollars initially, so he has 5 - 3 = 2.  The answer is 2. 
 Ronnie was given 5 dollars.  Rissa was given 3 times as much, so Rissa had 5 x 3 = 15 dollars.  After each of them gave an equal amount to their little sister, they each had the same amount left.  Rissa then had 4/5 of her money left.  4/5 of 15 is 12.  So she gave 15 - 12 = 3 dollars to her little sister.  Ronnie also gave an equal amount, so Ronnie gave 3 dollars to his little sister.  Ronnie started with 5 dollars.  5 - 3 is 2.  The answer is 2. 
 Ronnie and Rissa are given $5 and $15 respectively.  Note that Rissa has three times as much as Ronnie.  After giving the same amount to their little sister, Rissa will be left with 4/5 of $15, which is 4/5 * 15 = 12.  That means Ronnie's sister received 15 - 12 = 3 dollars.  So $5 - 3 = $2.  The answer is 2. 
 Let's start by finding out how much money Rissa was given initially.  Since Rissa received three times as much money as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given 5 dollars, Rissa was given 5 * 3 = 15 dollars. 

After Rissa gives an equal amount of money to her little sister, she is left with 4/5 of her original amount.  This means that the amount she gave away is the amount left over, which is 15 - (4/5 * 15) = 15 - 12 = 3. 

Since Rissa gave an equal amount to Ronnie, Ronnie also gave 3 dollars to his little sister.  Ronnie was initially given 5 dollars, so now he has 5 - 3 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2. 
 Ronnie starts with $5.  Rissa is given thrice as much, so she is given 3 x 5 = 15 dollars.  After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, we don't know how much they both gave, but we know that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, which is 15.  15 is 5/5 + 4/5, so they gave 1/5 of her money away.  So she gave 1/5 of 15 = 3 dollars.  Ronnie gave the same amount, so Ronnie also gave 3 dollars.  Ronnie is left with his original 5 - 3 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2. 
 Ronnie was given 5 dollars.  Rissa got three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa got 5 * 3 = 15 dollars.  After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, they had 5 - x and 15 - x dollars left respectively.  But Rissa was left with 4/5 of her money (15 - x), so 4/5 * 15 - x = 15 - x.  This simplifies to 12 - x = 15 - x, so x = 3.  This means they gave 3 dollars each to their little sister.  So Ronnie was left with 5 - 3 = 2 dollars and Rissa was left with 15 - 3 * 4/5 = 6 dollars.  So the answer is 2. 
 Ronnie was given 5 dollars.  Rissa was given 3 times as much, so she got 5 x 3 = 15 dollars.  After giving the same amount to their little sister, they both gave the same amount.  Since Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, that means she gave the remaining 1/5 away.  
She had 15 dollars, and now she is left with 4/5 x 15 = 12.  This means she gave away 15 - 12 = 3 dollars.  Since she and Ronnie gave the same amount to their sister, Ronnie also gave 3 dollars.  Ronnie started with 5 dollars, and gave away 3.  So he has 5 - 3 = 2 dollars left.  The answer is 2. 
 Ronnie was given $5 while Rissa is given thrice as much which means Rissa got 5 * 3 = 15.  After giving away an equal amount of money to Rissa's little sister, we don't know how much exactly Ronnie gave but Rissa was left with 4/5 of her money.  This means 15 - 3/5 * 15 = 15 - 12 = 3.

He also buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which means 10 x 2 = 20 bottles of cognac. 
The cognac costs 50% more per bottle, so if 1 bottle of scotch is 60 dollars, then 1 bottle of cognac is 60 + 30 = 90 dollars. 
Then the total cost of cognac is 20 x 90 = 1800 dollars. 
Total cost of scotch and cognac is 600 + 1800 = 2400 dollars.  The answer is 2400. 
10 bottles of scotch for $600 means each bottle of scotch cost $60 (600 / 10).  Then John bought twice as many bottles of cognac, which means he bought 10 x 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.  Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than each bottle of scotch, which is $90 per bottle.  So the total cost of cognac is 20 x 90 = 1800.  The total amount he spent on everything is $600 (for scotch) + $1800 (for cognac) = $2400.  The answer is 2400. 
10 bottles of scotch at $600 total means that each bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.  He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so he buys 10 x 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.  Cognac costs 50% more than scotch, so it costs 1. 5 x $60 per bottle.  So the total cost of the 20 bottles of cognac is 20 x $90 = $1800.  Finally, total cost is 600 + 1800 = $2400.  The answer is 2400. 
 Let's break this down step by step. 

1.  John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600.  To find the cost per bottle, we need to divide $600 by 10 bottles.  600/10 = 60, so each bottle of scotch costs $60. 

2.  He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which means he buys 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac. 

3.  Cognac costs 50% more than scotch, so if scotch costs $60 per bottle, cognac costs $60 + 50% of $60.  50% of $60 is $30.  $60 + $30 = $90.  So each bottle of cognac costs $90. 

4.  To find the total cost of cognac, we multiply the number of bottles by the cost per bottle.  20 * 90 = 1800.  So the total cost of cognac is $1800. 

5.  To find the total cost of all items, we add the cost of scotch and cognac.  $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.  The answer is 2400. 
10 bottles of scotch cost 600 dollars, so each bottle of scotch is $600 ÷ 10 = $60.  John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so that is 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.  Since cognac is 50% more expensive per bottle, each cognac bottle costs $60 * 1. 5 = $90.  John bought 20 * 90 = 1800 dollars worth of cognac.  His total spending is $600 on scotch and $1800 on cognac, so in total he spent $600 + 1800 = $2400. 

The answer is 2400. 
 John bought 10 bottles of scotch.  The cost of each scotch is not given, but the total cost is $600.  So the cost of each bottle is 600/10 = 60.  

He also buys twice as many bottles of cognac.  So he buys 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.  The cost of each bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost of each bottle of scotch.  The cost of each bottle of scotch is 60.  50% more means 150%, or 150/100 * 60 = 90 dollars.  

So, John spends 60 dollars for each bottle of scotch and 90 dollars for each bottle of cognac.  In total, he spends 10 * 60 + 20 * 90 = 600 + 1800 = 2400 dollars.  The answer is 2400.

Since each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.  Since treats are either cupcakes or brownies, we can set up an equation: 10 = X + (3 * X - 2).  Simplifying the equation, we get: 10 = 4X - 2, and then 12 = 4X, and finally X = 3.  The answer is 3. 
 Let's start by defining some variables.  Let x be the number of cupcakes Carly made.  Let y be the number of brownies she made.  We know that y is 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.  So, we can write an equation: y = 3x - 2 

In total, Carly has 2 treats per person, and there are 5 people in her class.  So the total number of treats is 5 x 2 = 10.  The total number of treats made by Carly is equal to the number of cups and brownies she made: x + y = 10

We can substitute the first equation into the second one to get: x + (3x - 2) = 10

Combine like terms: 4x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4x = 12

[EXP] 180: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]: 6 hours each day for 5 days makes 6 * 5 = 30 hours.  Each hour has 60 minutes, so there are 30 * 60 = 1800 minutes.  Each call takes 15 minutes, so the number of calls is 1800 / 15 = 120.  The answer is 120. 
 Tim spends 6 hours per day at work, that's 6 x 60 = 360 minutes.  It takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call, so he can deal with 360 / 15 = 24 calls per day.  During his 5 day work week, he can deal with 24 * 5 = 120 calls.  The answer is 120. 
6 hours each day at work x 60 minutes per hour = 360 minutes per day.  360 minutes per day / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.  In a 5 day week, he will deal with 5 x 24 = 120 calls.  The answer is 120. 
 Tim spends 6 hours at work each day, and he takes 15 minutes, or 0. 25 hours, to deal with a call.  So, in one day, he can deal with 6/0. 25 = 24 calls.  In 5 days, he can deal with 5 x 24 = 120 calls.  The answer is 120. 
6 hours per day * 5 days = 30 hours.  Each hour has 60 minutes, so 30 hours has 30 * 60 = 1800 minutes.  Then, if it takes him 15 minutes for each call, 1800 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 120 calls.  The answer is 120. 
 Tim works 6 hours a day.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he answers 6 * 60 = 360 minutes of calls per day.  It takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call, so he answers 360 / 15 = 24 calls a day.  Since he works 5 days a week, that's 5 * 24 = 120.  The answer is 120. 
 If it takes Tim 15 minutes to deal with a call and he spends 6 hours at work, that is the same as 6 hours * 60 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.  Tim works for 5 days, so in total he deals with 5 * 24 calls = 120 calls.  The answer is 120. 
 6 hours a day * 60 minutes in an hour = 360 minutes per day.  He takes 15 minutes to deal with a call.  So he deals with 360 / 15 = 24 calls per day.  There are 5 days in a work week.  24 calls per day * 5 days = 120 calls in a week.  The answer is 120. 
 Tim spends 6 hours each day at work, which is 6 * 60 = 360 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).  Each call takes Tim 15 minutes to deal with.  So he can deal with 360 / 15 = 24 calls in a day.  Then for a 5-day week, he can deal with 24 * 5 = 120 calls.  The answer is 120.

32 + 2 x 3 = 32 + 6 = 38
The answer is 38. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 

The cost of adult tickets is 2 x $12 = $24.  The cost of a child ticket is $8.  So the total cost of the tickets is $24 + $8 = $32. 

They also buy 2 popcorns for $3 each.  That's 2 x $3 = $6. 

The total amount they pay is $32 + $6 = $38.  The answer is 38. 
 Let's break this down step by step. 

The family consists of 3 people: 2 adults and 1 child.  So, the total cost of tickets is:
2 adults * $12 = $24
1 child * $8 = $8
Total tickets cost: $24 + $8 = $32

Then, they buy 2 popcorns for $3 each:
2 popcorns * $3 = $6
Total cost of snacks: $6

Adding the cost of tickets and snacks, the total amount they pay is:
$32 + $6 = $38

The answer is 38. 
 The family has 3 members.  The parents are adults, so 2 adult tickets will cost 2 x 12 = 24 dollars.  The child ticket is 8 dollars, so total cost of tickets will be 24 + 8 = 32 dollars.  Then they bought 2 popcorns for 3 dollars each.  So the cost of popcorns will be 2 x 3 = 6 dollars.  Total cost will be 32 + 6 = 38 dollars.  The answer is 38. 
 The family is 3 people in total.  The cost of adult tickets is 2 x 12 = 24 dollars.  The cost of a child ticket is 1 x 8 = 8 dollars.  So, they pay 8 + 24 = 32 dollars for tickets.  2 popcorns for 3 dollars each will be 2 x 3 = 6 dollars.  In total they pay 32 + 6 = 38 dollars.  The answer is 38. 
 Since there are 2 adults and 1 child, the total cost for the tickets will be:
2 adults x 12 dollars each = 2 x 12 = 24 dollars
1 child x 8 dollars = 8 dollars
Total ticket cost = 24 + 8 = 32 dollars

Then, they buy 2 popcorns for $3 each:
2 popcorns x 3 dollars each = 2 x 3 = 6 dollars
Total cost for popcorns = 6 dollars

Total amount paid = Total cost for tickets + Total cost for popcorns = 32 dollars + 6 dollars = 38 dollars

The answer is 38. 
 Let's start by calculating the cost of the tickets for the parents and the child.  A parent is an adult, so each adult ticket costs $12.  Since there are 2 parents, the total cost of their tickets is 2 x 12 = 24 dollars.  The child ticket costs $8, so the total cost of the tickets is 24 + 8 = 32 dollars.  Then, they buy 2 popcorns for $3 each.  2 x 3 = 6 dollars.  So, the total cost is 32 + 6 = 38 dollars.  The answer is 38. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 

The family consists of 3 people, so we need to calculate the cost of the tickets.  2 adults and 1 child. 
The cost of 2 adult tickets is 2 x 12 = 24 dollars. 
The cost of 1 child ticket is 1 x 8 = 8 dollars. 
Total ticket cost is 24 + 8 = 32 dollars. 
They also buy 2 popcorns for 3 dollars each, so the cost of popcorn is 2 x 3 = 6 dollars. 
Total cost is the sum of ticket cost and popcorn cost, so 32 + 6 = 38 dollars. 
The answer is 38. 
1.  Determine the number of adult and child tickets.  

There is 1 child.  The parents are the ones who are not children, so there are 2 adults. 

2.  Calculate the cost of the tickets:

The cost of 2 adult tickets is 2 * 12 = 24 dollars. 
The cost of 1 child ticket is 1 * 8 = 8 dollars. 

The total cost of the tickets is 24 + 8 = 32 dollars. 

3.  Calculate the cost of the popcorn:

They bought 2 popcorns for 3 dollars each, so the cost of the popcorn is 2 * 3 = 6 dollars. 

4.  Add the cost of the tickets and the popcorn:

The total amount they pay is 32 + 6 = 38 dollars. 

The answer is 38. 
 The family consists of 3 members.  One is the child and the parents are the other two.  So we need to add the cost of the adult tickets and the child ticket.  The cost of the adult tickets is 2 * $12 = $24.  The child ticket is $8.  $24 + $8 = $32.  If they pay 2 popcorns for $3 each, then it is 2 * $3 = $6.  So, the total cost is $32 + $6 = $38.

Each day, Charisma meditates for 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.  28 days of meditation will be 28 * 30 minutes = 840 minutes.  Additionally, she practices yoga for 5 days a week, and that's 1 hour each day.  5 days a week for 4 weeks means 5 * 4 = 20 days.  20 hours total.  20 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1200 minutes.  In total, she has practiced meditation and yoga for 840 + 1200 minutes.  That is 2040 minutes.  The answer is 2040. 
 Charisma meditates twice a day, for 15 minutes.  This is 15 x 2 minutes a day.  15 x 2 = 30 minutes a day.  Since this is for 7 days a week, she spends 30 x 7 = 210 minutes a week on meditation. 

She practices yoga for 1 hour a day, which is 60 minutes.  Since this is for 5 days a week, she spends 60 x 5 = 300 minutes a week on yoga. 

In one week, Charisma spends 210 minutes on meditation and 300 minutes on yoga.  The total is 210 + 300 = 510 minutes.

So Ryan now has 18 - 5 = 13 dollars.  To buy movie tickets, each costs 6. 50 dollars.  He can buy 13 / 6. 50.  13 / 6. 5 is 2.  The answer is 2. 
 Let's start by finding out how much money Ryan has. 

Ryan gets 6 dollars per week, and he completes his chores for 3 weeks.  So Ryan has 6 * 3 = 18 dollars. 

Then Ryan buys ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at 1. 25 each.  That's 1. 25 * 4 = 5 dollars.  So Ryan now has 18 - 5 = 13 dollars. 

Now Ryan has 13 dollars and each movie ticket costs 6. 50.  So Ryan can buy 13 / 6. 50 = 2 movie tickets. 

The answer is 2. 
 Ryan gets 6 dollars for each week he completes his chores.  Since he did his chores for 3 weeks, he gets 6 * 3 = 18 dollars.  He then spent money on ice cream cones.  4 ice cream cones at 1. 25 dollars each will be 4 * 1. 25 = 5 dollars.  So he has 18 - 5 = 13 dollars left after buying ice cream cones.  Now, he wants to buy movie tickets.  Each ticket costs 6. 5 dollars, so 1 ticket = 6. 5.  Tickets bought = 13 / 6. 5.  13 divided by 6. 5 is 2.  The answer is 2. 
 First, let's find out how much money Ryan has.  He receives $6 each week for 3 weeks, so he has 6 x 3 = 18 dollars.  Then, he spends money on ice cream cones.  If they cost 1. 25 each and he bought 4 of them (one for himself and 3 for friends), he spent 4 x 1. 25 = 5 dollars.  So he has 18 - 5 = 13 dollars left.  Then, he wants to buy movie tickets for 6. 50 each.  To find out how many he can buy, we'll divide 13 by 6. 50.  13 / 6. 50 is 2 with a remainder of 1.  He can buy 2 movie tickets.  The answer is 2. 
 Ryan starts with 0 dollars because we don't know how much he earned until we add up his allowance.  After completing chores for 3 weeks, he earned 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.  Then he bought ice cream cones at 1. 25 each for a total of 1. 25 x 4 = 5 dollars.  18 - 5 = 13.  After buying some ice cream cones, he has 13 dollars left.  Each movie ticket costs 6. 5 dollars.  He can buy 13 / 6. 5 movie tickets.  13 / 6. 5 = 2.  The answer is 2. 
 Ryan earns $6 each week for completing his chores.  For 3 weeks, he earned $6 x 3 = $18.  He then spent money on ice cream cones for himself and his friends.  Each ice cream cone cost $1. 25, and he got ice cream for himself and 3 friends, so that's 4 ice cream cones.  $1. 25 x 4 = $5.  So he spent $5 on ice cream cones, and now he has $18 - $5 = $13.  Then he wants to go to the movies with his friends and the tickets cost $6. 50 each.  Each of them wants to go, so there are 4 people going.  Each ticket is $6. 50, so they need 4 x $6. 50 = $26 to buy the movie tickets.  Since Ryan only has $13 left, he can buy $13 / $6. 50 = 2 movie tickets.  The answer is 2. 
 Ryan gets 6 dollars allowance each week he completes his chores.  He completed his chores for 3 weeks, so he has 6 * 3 = 18 dollars in total.  At first, he buys ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends.  An ice cream cone for 1 person is $1. 25, and they need 4 cones.  So they spent 4 * 1. 25 = 5 dollars.  18 - 5 = 13 dollars left.  Now they all want to go to the movies and tickets cost $6. 50 each.  They need to buy 4 tickets, one for each of them.  4 * 6. 50 = 26, but they only have 13 dollars left.  26 is much higher than 13.  Let's find the biggest number of tickets they can buy with 13 dollars.  6 * 2 = 12.  Adding 1 more for Ryan is 1 more dollar, which is 13.  The answer is 2.

400 is the cost of the radiator originally.  Getting it for 80% off means it costs 20% now.  20% of 400 is 80, so it costs 400 - 80 = 320.  Then the mechanic charges $50 an hour to install it for 3 hours.  So it costs 3 * 50 = 150 for installation.  320 + 150 = 470.  The answer is 470. 
 Stand back to calculate the discounted price of the radiator.  80% off is same as 100% - 80% = 20%.  So the cost is 400 * 0. 2 = 80 dollars.  So the new cost of radiator is 400 - 80 = 320.
