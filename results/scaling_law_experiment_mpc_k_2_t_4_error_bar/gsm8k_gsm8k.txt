[EXP] 1: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 3 eggs go for breakfast, so 16 - 3 = 13 eggs are left.  Then 4 eggs are used for muffins.  So, 13 - 4 = 9 eggs are left to sell at the market.  The eggs sell for $2 each, so the total amount earned is 9 x 2 = 18 dollars.  The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 2: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 160, [output]: 200 GB is the total size of the file.  Carla downloads 2 GB/minute, so to find out how many minutes it would normally take, we divide 200 GB by 2 GB/minute.  200 / 2 = 100.  So it would normally take 100 minutes.  Then, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes.   After the restart, the file is "40% of the way through the download", which means 0. 4 * 200 = 80 GB have been downloaded.   So Carla has to download the remaining 200 - 80 = 120 GB.   Now, to find out how many minutes Carla takes to download the remaining 120 GB, we divide 120 by 2 GB/minute.   120 / 2 = 60.  So Carla has to download for 60 more minutes.  In total, Carla has to download for 100 minutes (original download) + 20 minutes (Windows restart) + 60 minutes (second part of the download) = 180 minutes.    The answer is 180. 
[EXP] 3: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]: 20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance, so 20% of 20 students is 20% x 20 = 4 students.  After that, there are 20 - 4 = 16 students left.  Then 25% of these remaining students enrolled in jazz dance.  25% of 16 students is 25% x 16 = 4 students.  Thus, after these students enrolled in jazz dance, there are 16 - 4 = 12 students left.   Since 12 students out of 20 students enrolled in hip-hop dance, the percentage is 12/20 = 60%.   The answer is 60%. 
[EXP] 4: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Samantha is 31 years old.  Raymond is 6 years younger than Samantha, so Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.  Raymond had a son when Raymond was 23.  So the son is 25 - 23 = 2 years younger than Raymond. 2 years ago, Raymond's son was born.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 5: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]: 60 miles is the total distance of the trip, and we know that Henry made two stops. 20 miles is the distance before the first stop, so the remaining distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.  The second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip, so 40 - 15 = 25 miles is the distance from the first stop to the second stop.  Then, to find the miles traveled between the first and second stops, we take the distance from the first stop to the second stop (25) and subtract the 20 we already traveled before the first stop (25 - 20 = 5).   The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 6: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Mike started with 4 points.  In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more.   25% of 4 is 1.   4 + 1 is 5.   So in total he scores 4 + 5 = 9 points.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 7: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]:  Grandma Jones started with 5 pies, each cut into 8 pieces.  So there were 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of pie in total.   At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining.  So the guests took 40 - 14 = 26 pieces of pie.  The answer is 26. 
[EXP] 8: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]: 15 floors in the building.  Each floor has 8 units, so there are 15 x 8 = 120 units.  3/4 of the building is occupied.   3/4 of 120 is (3/4) x 120 = 90.  So 90 units are occupied.   The total number of unoccupied units will be 120 - 90 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 9: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 42 dollars are available for the week.  Peter spends 7 + 7 = 14 dollars each time he goes to the movies. 42 / 14 = 3 times.  The answer is 3 times. 
[EXP] 10: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1596, [output]:  The streaming service charges $140 per month.  The year has 12 months.  For the first half of the year, that's 6 months.  So for the first half of the year, the total is 140 * 6 = 840 dollars.  For the second half of the year, they charged 10% less.   10% of 140 is 14 dollars, so they will charge 140 - 14 = 126 dollars for each of the 6 months in the second half.  The total for the second half is 126 * 6 = 756.  The total for the year is 840 + 756 = 1596.  The answer is 1596. 
[EXP] 11: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7425, [output]: 5 classes per day for 5 days is 5 x 5 = 25 classes.  8 classes on Saturday makes 25 + 8 = 33 classes in total.  Each class has 15 students.  So there are 15 x 33 = 495 students in total.  Each student pays 15 dollars.  So Judy makes 495 x 15 = 7425 dollars.  The answer is 7425. 
[EXP] 12: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.  If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, then Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.  The difference in the amount of laundry they do is 200 - 100 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 13: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  The football team played 22 games, but we want to know how many they won, not how many they played.  Let's call the number of won games "x" and the number of lost games "y".  Then, the number of played games is x + y = 22.   We know that they won 8 more games than they lost, so x = y + 8.   Let's create an equation from the two equations:

x + y = 22
x = y + 8

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

y + 8 + y = 22

Combine the y terms:

2y + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2y = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

y = 7

Now that we know y, we can solve for x:

x = y + 8
x = 7 + 8
x = 15

The football team won 15 games.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 14: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 28, [output]:  Let's start by figuring out how many pets Marcia has.  Since Cindy has 4 pets and Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.   Since Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, Jan has 6 * 3 = 18 pets.   In total, they have 4 + 6 + 18 pets, which is 28 pets.   The answer is 28. 
[EXP] 15: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 30 cars lined up. 5 cars took an exit, so the remaining 30 - 5 = 25 cars drove through.  They were split into two groups, one in the first 15 minutes and one in the remaining 15 minutes.  In the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through, and then 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.  So all the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes plus the 20 cars that drove through in the next 15 minutes is equal to 25 cars.   In other words, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 16: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Amir eats 5 cookies.  Cody eats 3 times as many, so he eats 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.  So together, they eat 5 + 15 = 20 cookies.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 17: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]: 4 teachers each teach 2 lessons. 2 * 4 = 8 lessons.  The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.  So in a day, the whiteboard is cleaned 8 * 3 times.  8 * 3 = 24.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 18: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 95200, [output]: 40000 is 30% higher than Lylah's salary. 30% of Lylah's salary is 0. 30 * x = 12,000, where x is Lylah's salary.  So, Lylah's salary was 12,000 / 0. 30000. 

Now, four years later, Adrien's salary had increased 40% more. 40% of 40000 is 16,000, so Adrien's new salary is 40000 + 16000 = 56000.  And since Adrien's salary increased at the same rate as Lylah's, her salary also increased 40% of her initial salary 12000, which is 4800.  12000 + 4800 = 16800.  Thus, after four years Adrien had 56000, and Lylah had 16800.   Adrien had 56000, and Lylah had 16800, so together they had 56000 + 16800 = 72800.   The answer is 72800. 
[EXP] 19: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 82, [output]:  Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages were bought. 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages. 38 chicken sausages and 44 fish sausages are a total of 38 + 44 = 82.  The answer is 82. 
[EXP] 20: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Let's start by calculating how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.  He walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, so he walked 6 x 4 = 24 miles on Tuesday.  Therefore, Walt walked a total of 4 + 24 = 28 miles from Monday through Tuesday.   The problem states that he walked a total of 41 miles from Monday through Wednesday, so he must have walked 41 - 28 = 13 miles on Wednesday.  The answer is 13. 
[EXP] 21: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 20 cars are available, and 12 are automatic, which leaves 20 - 12 = 8 cars remaining. 8 cars are semi-automatic.  We need to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars. 

To do this, first, we need to find the total number of non-automatic cars.  There are 20 total cars, and 12 are automatic, so 20 - 12 = 8 cars are not automatic.  This 8 cars includes both semi-automatic and manual cars. 

Out of these 8 cars, 4 are manual.   So the remaining cars that are not automatic are semi-automatic.   8 - 4 = 4 semi-automatic cars.  To find the percentage, divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of non-automatic cars and multiply by 100:

(4 / 8) * 100 = 50%

So, 50% of the cars for rent are semi-automatic.  The answer is 50%. 
[EXP] 22: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 75, [output]: 30 bees left in the first 6 hours, and then 1/2 that number return. 30 divided by 2 is 15.  So 15 bees returned in the next 6 hours.  Then 2 times as many bees left in the next 6 hours.  30 x 2 = 60.  So 60 bees left in the next 6 hours.  But we are only interested in how many returned in the last 6 hours.   All the bees that left before that haven't returned yet, so we need to figure out how many left before that.  30 left in the first 6 hours and then 60 left in the next 6 hours.   In total, 30 + 60 = 90 bees left.   Since 15 returned in the next 6 hours, 90 - 15 = 75 bees haven't yet returned.   All these 75 bees return in the last 6 hours.  The answer is 75. 
[EXP] 23: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 272, [output]:  Kimo spends 3 * 1 = 3 hours each on mondays, wednesdays and fridays for a total of 3 * 3 = 9 hours.  On tuesdays and thursdays, he spends 2 * 2 = 4 hours each for a total of 4 * 2 = 8 hours.  So in one week, he spends 9 + 8 = 17 hours.  For 16 weeks, he spends 16 * 17 = 272 hours.  The answer is 272. 
[EXP] 24: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]:  Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.  So Anakin caught a total of 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.   Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.  Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.  Locsin caught 2 more clownfish, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.    So Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.  In total, they caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 25: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Ethel has 8 dollars. 2 times that is 8 x 2 = 16.  Jimmy has 2 more than that, so he has 16 + 2 = 18.  The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 26: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  Juan and his brother Carlos make a profit of 25 dollars.  They make a profit.  They sell lemonade at 50 cents per glass and get 20 glasses per gallon.   So each gallon they make 20 x 50 cents = 10 dollars.   Since it costs 5 dollars to make a gallon, they make 10 - 5 = 5 dollars profit per gallon.   They made 25 dollars in total.  So they must have made 25 / 5 = 5 gallons.  It costs 3 dollars for lemons.   Each gallon costs 3 dollars for lemons.   So for 5 gallons it will be 3 x 5 = 15 dollars.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 27: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 23, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step.  

Jan is 30, and we know that she is older than Mark.  We don't know his age, but we'll get to that in a bit.  Mark is two years younger than Jean.   So Jean's age will equal Mark's age, plus 2. 

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.   Half of 30 is 15.  So two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20.  We know that this was two years ago, so his current age is 22.  

Now we know Mark's age: 22.   It is two years younger than Jean.  So Jean's age will be 22 + 2 = 24.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 28: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]: 3 friends spent $20. 25 on tickets.  Then they spent $4. 50 less on food than on tickets.  So they spent 20. 25 - 4. 50 = 15. 75 on food.  Then they went on 2 rides that each cost $33.   2 x 33 = 66.   In total, they spent 20. 25 + 15. 75 + 66 = 102.   This is what they split evenly.  If 3 people split the total cost, each paid 102 ÷ 3 = 34.  The answer is 34. 
[EXP] 29: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]: 200 pounds of carrots are originally.  Each of the 40 restaurants will get 2 pounds.  That is a total of 40 x 2 = 80 pounds.  So the remaining 200 - 80 = 120 pounds will not be used.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 30: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 31, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step.  Carl used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, and he had sandwiches for lunch every day this week.  There are 7 days in a week, so he used 2 x 7 = 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches. 

He used 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than per sandwich, so that means he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese per omelet.  He had omelets for breakfast 3 days, so he used 3 x 3 = 9 slices of cheese for omelets. 14 + 9 = 23.  

He used 8 slices of cheese for his macaroni and cheese dish.   23 + 8 = 31.  The answer is 31. 
[EXP] 31: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Sara wants to buy a jacket for $30 and 2 pairs of shoes for 2 x 20 = 40.  So she needs a total of $30 + 40 = $70.  Sara starts with $10 and earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn.  

Let's see how much money she can save by babysitting.  In one babysitting gig, she earns 5 dollars.  After one babysitting gig, she will have 10 + 5 = 15 dollars.   After the next babysitting gig, she will have 15 + 5 = 20.   After the next babysitting gig, she will have 20 + 5 = 25 dollars.  After the next babysitting gig, she will have 25 + 5 = 30 dollars.  If she babysits for a fifth time, she will have 30 + 5 = 35 dollars.   After babysitting for 6th time, she will have 35 + 5 = 40 dollars.  If she babysits for a 7th time, she will have 40 + 5 = 45 dollars.   So it takes her 7 times of babysitting to earn a total of 45 dollars.   

Now, let's see how much money she can earn by mowing the lawn.   She earns 4 dollars each time she mows the lawn.  She needs to earn 70 - 10 = 60 dollars more to buy the jacket and shoes.  Let's divide the 60 dollars by the 4 dollars she earns per lawn mowing - 60 / 4 = 15.   Therefore, Sara will have to mow the lawn 15 times to earn the remaining 60 dollars.  And she already needs to babysit 7 times.   To find the answer, we add the times: 7 babysitting + 15 lawn mowing = 22 times in total. 
[EXP] 32: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  There are originally 4 roses in the vase. 7 more dahlias than roses means that 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.  So in total there are 4 roses and 11 dahlias. 4 + 11 is 15.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 33: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 180, [output]:  Carlos uses the canoe for 3 hours, which will cost 3 x 30 = 90 dollars.  Benji uses the raft for 5 hours, which will cost 5 x 18 = 90 dollars.  In total, they will pay 90 + 90 = 180 dollars.  The answer is 180. 
[EXP] 34: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Kylie started by collecting 5 more shells than Robert, who collected 20 shells.  So Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells. 

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday.  So Kylie collects 2 * 25 = 50 shells on Tuesday.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 35: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 68, [output]:  We can start with Jessa and work our way up.  Jessa is 20 years old.  Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.  Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.   Now we need to find the sum of the ages.  Jessa is 20, Joan is 25, and Mary is 23.  So the sum of their ages is 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.  The answer is 68. 
[EXP] 36: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Let's start by finding the total number of snails: 4 + 32 = 36 snails.  The difference between the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.  According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish.  So if the number of fish is x, we can set up the equation:

2x = 28

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

x = 14

So there are 14 fish in each aquarium.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 37: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 73, [output]: 10 wolves and 15 cougars were killed last night.  Today, Rick killed 3 times as many wolves as cougars, so if he killed X cougars, that means he killed 3X wolves.  But it was also stated that the number of cougars killed today was 3 fewer than yesterday, so we have X = 15 - 3 = 12 cougars. 3 times as many wolves as cougars is 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.  So in total he killed 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals.  Last night Rick killed 10 + 15 = 25 animals.  So together he killed 25 + 48 = 73 animals.  The answer is 73. 
[EXP] 38: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 168, [output]: 1. - We will find out how many fruits all together after finding how many fruits each has. 2.  - Let's start with Andrea.  She has 8 more apples than Jamal.  We know she has 52 apples, so Jamal must have 52 - 8 = 44 apples.  Therefore, Jamal has 44 apples and some bananas.  3.  - Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.   4.   - We also know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.   That means she has 48 ÷ 2 = 24 bananas.  5.  - Now we have to find the number of fruits in total.   Andrea has 52 apples, 24 bananas.    Jamal has 44 apples, 48 bananas.   So let's make a table:
                                            |  Apples  |  Bananas  | Fruits
  Andrea   |     52    |     24    |   76
  Jamal    |     44    |     48    |   92.  - Let's add the fruits together.  76 + 92 = 168.   6.    - Finally, the answer is 168. 
[EXP] 39: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 118000, [output]: 400,000 is the original house price.  To find the transfer fees, we multiply 3% * 400,000.  That's 12,000 dollars.  To find the brokerage fee, we multiply 5% * 400,000.  That's 20,000 dollars.  Total of these fees is 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000.  So, Mr.  Tan paid 32,000 + 250,000 = 282,000 for fees and loan.  To find the net proceeds, subtract the fees and loan from the original price.  That is 400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000.  The answer is 118,000. 
[EXP] 40: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 315, [output]: 1800 is the total number of stitches.  The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, which leaves 1800 - 900 = 900 for the rest.  The collar takes 1/10th of the body, so it takes 1/10th of 900 which is 90.  The rosette takes twice that, so it takes 2 x 90 = 180.   That leaves 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 for the two sleeves.   Since there are two sleeves, divide 630 by 2 and it's 315 stitches per sleeve.  The answer is 315. 
[EXP] 41: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]: 20 popsicles at $0. 25 each will be 20 x 0. 25 = 5.  4 ice cream bars at $0. 50 each will be 4 x 0. 50 = 2.  In total, Peter paid 5 + 2 = 7.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 42: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 76-star flag has three rows of 8 stars, which is 3 x 8 = 24 stars.  Then 2 rows of 6 stars, which is 2 x 6 = 12 stars.  The rest of the stars are 5-star rows.  The total number of stars without 5-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.  The total number of stars in the flag is 76, so the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40, but there are multiples of 5-star rows, so the number of rows is 40 / 5 = 8.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 43: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Will buys 15 oranges. 

The oldest son is 8 years old and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.  In total, the two sons can wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.  After they wash 12 oranges, Will will have 15 - 12 = 3 oranges left unwashed.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 44: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 32 page tabloid requires 32 pages of print.  But we are folding paper in half, so we only need half as much paper.  The paper is then folded in half again, so we need half the pieces as before, or quarter as much.  

So how many pieces do we need? We need to take the number of pages in the tabloid, and divide it by 4, twice. 32 / 4 = 8.  8 / 4 = 2.   The answer is 2 pieces of paper. 
[EXP] 45: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]: 2 tubs of ice cream would normally be 2 x 13 = 26 dollars.  But it is now 2 x 11 = 22.  So there is a savings of 26 - 22 = 4 dollars.  

A packet of milk is sold at a discount of $0. 5.  But it is not specified how many packets he is buying.   So we cannot determine the discount.  But we know the total items are 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.  We can determine the savings for ice cream and that is 4 dollars.  If there was a discount for milk and it was the same for each packet, then the total savings would be 4 dollars for ice cream and 2 x 0. 5 = 1 dollar for milk.   That is 4 + 1 = 5 dollars in total. 

But there is no discount for milk, so the total savings is only 4 dollars.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 46: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]: 2 families with 6 people each means 2 x 6 = 12 people.  3 families with 4 people each means 3 x 4 = 12 people.  So, 12 + 12 = 24 people were invited.  Initially, 8 people couldn't come due to illness, leaving 24 - 8 = 16. 8 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 that number, or 8 / 4 = 2 people, had previous commitments, leaves 16 - 2 = 14 people who can come to Martha's party.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 47: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Jam has three boxes full of pencils. 2 pencils are loose, so in total she has 2 + 3*? = 26.  This is an equation.  2 + 3x = 26, where x is the number of pencils in one box.  To solve the equation, subtract 2 from both sides: 3x = 26 - 2 = 24.   Then divide both sides by 3: x = 24/3 = 8.   So each box has 8 pencils.  Since she has 3 boxes full of pencils, 3 x 8 = 24 pencils in the boxes.   The remaining 2 pencils are loose.   The total number of pencils Jam has is 2 + 24 = 26.   
 Now, Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46.  In total, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.  To find out how many boxes they need in total, we can divide 72 by the number of pencils in a box.  72 / 8 = 9.   So they need 9 boxes in total.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 48: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Erin had 7 lollipops initially.  Then she got 10 more from her mother.  7 + 10 = 17.  If she gives 3 lollipops to Ella, she has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 49: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 72, [output]: 8 shares of stock for 8 dollars each means Maria initially has 8 * 8 = 64 dollars worth of stock.  The first year, the price increases 50%.  To find 50% of 64, it's like dividing 64 by 2 and then multiplying by 2 (2*32 = 64) so the increase in value of the stock is 32 dollars.  So after the first year, the value is 64 + 32 = 96.   The second year, the stock price decreases 25%.   To find 25% of 96, it's like dividing 96 by 4 (4*24 = 96) so the decrease in value of the stock is 24 dollars.  So after the second year, the value is 96 - 24 = 72.  The answer is 72. 
[EXP] 50: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 180000, [output]:  Tyson runs 5000 meters daily.  Since his coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters, it means he will run 5000 + (5000 / 5) = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters per day.  If he does this for a month (30 days), the total distance covered is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.  The answer is 180,000. 
[EXP] 51: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Peyton starts with 0 hours of planned activities.  Then:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: Cooking class lasts 3 times as long as yoga class, so it takes 1 x 3 = 3 hours.  1 + 3 = 4 hours
- Wednesday: Half-hour cheese-tasting event.  4 + 0. 5 = 4. 5 hours
- Thursday: The museum tour takes half as long as the cooking class.   So, 3 / 2 = 1. 5 hours.  4. 5 + 1.  5 = 6 hours
- Friday: 2 hours of errands.  6 + 2 = 8 hours
The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 52: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Morgan's dad gave her a budget of 90 dollars.  The mini-golf cost 5 dollars, and she wants to play once.  The arcade tokens are 5 dollars.  Two rides of go-karts cost 10 x 2 = 20 dollars.  These costs together are 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 dollars.   She is left with 90 - 30 = 60 dollars.   If each friend costs 10 dollars to go for the go-karts, she can invite 60 / 10 = 6 friends.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 53: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 49, [output]:  First, we need to find the total number of fourth-grade students who were absent.  5 girls and 4 boys were absent, so that's a total of 5 + 4 = 9 students.  The girls make up 43 of the fourth-graders, so the boys make up the remaining 96 - 43 = 53 fourth-graders.  If 4 of those boys were absent, then the number of boys who were at school on Friday was 53 - 4 = 49.  The answer is 49. 
[EXP] 54: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. 

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday.  So they sold 2 x 14 = 28 pairs of shoes. 

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before.  On Saturday they sold 28 pairs, so on Sunday they sold 28/2 = 14 pairs.  But 6 people returned their shoes because they didn't fit, so the store sold 14 - 6 = 8 pairs of shoes on Sunday.  

To find the total number of shoes sold by the end of the sale, add up the number of shoes sold each day: 
14 + 28 + 8 = 50 

The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 55: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 50 socks need washing originally. 10 pairs of socks is 10 x 2 = 20 socks washed. 15 loose socks make a total of 20 + 15 = 35 socks washed. 50 - 35 = 15 socks left over.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 56: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]: 50% of the total 52 members are boys, which is 26 (52 ÷ 2 = 26).  The remaining 52 - 26 = 26 are girls.   If only female members perform, there will be 26 of them.  If half of them can't make it, then 26 ÷ 2 = 13 won't make it and 26 - 13 = 13 will make it.  The 3 teachers then join the remaining 13, making a total of 13 + 3 = 16 people.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 57: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 34, [output]:  There are no trees, cars, chocolates, lollipops, or toys in this problem, so we don't solve it the same way as those examples.  This problem tells us how much money Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription.  It says he gets Netflix for $10 and Hulu and Disney Plus for $10 each, but with a discount for bundling.  First, let's find out how much the cable package was.  It was $60 a month, so that's the amount Tim will save.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 58: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Alice is 7 years older than Beth, who is 5 years older than Erica.  So Beth is 5 years older than Erica, which means Beth must be 30 + 5 = 35.  Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice must be 35 + 7 = 42.  

The problem asks for the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica.  42 - 30 is 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 59: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 200, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the number of corns.  There are twice as many corns as cannolis, and there are 40 cannolis.  So there are 40 x 2 = 80 corns. 

Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so the number of cannolis became 40 + 60 = 100.  He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so 100 - 40 = 60 corns were bought.  The total number of corns is now 80 + 60 = 140.  

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is 140 + 100 = 240.  The answer is 240. 
[EXP] 60: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]: 0

Explanation: Since the 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, that means 5% of 50,000 will have this defect: 0. 05 x 50,000 = 2500. 99% of the candles are not guaranteed to explode, so 1% are guaranteed to explode. 1% of 50,000 is 0. 01 x 50,000 = 500.  The problem asks for the intersection of the set of candles that explode and the set of candles that smell like wet dog.  This is an AND condition, so we can't simply add the two numbers together.  Since neither 2500 nor 500 are candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, the answer is 0. 
[EXP] 61: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 17000, [output]:  Mr.  Josue started with $5000 in capital.  The first bank gave him $4000 and the second bank gave him twice as much.  Twice as much as$4000 is 2 x $4000 =$8000.  So he received a total of $4000 +$8000 = $12000.  Now he has a total of$5000 + $12000 =$16000. 

The answer is $16000. 
[EXP] 62: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 150, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of them.  Since he gets $1. 5 per card, he makes a total of:

(2/3 × X) × $1. 50 = total amount of money he gets from selling cards

where X is the number of cards he started with. 

Since he has $50 left after buying the ticket, he needs:

$100 - $50 = $50 more to buy the ticket.  This amount is equal to the total amount of money he got from selling cards.  So:

(2/3 × X) × $1.  50 = $50

Now, to solve for X, we can divide both sides by (2/3 × $1.  50) and get:

X = $50 / (2/3 × $1.  50)
X = $50 / (2/3 × $1.  50)
X = $50 / ($1.  50 * 3/2)
X = $50 / $1.  75
X = 28. 57


Since Kenny can't sell a fractional number of cards, we can round down to the nearest whole number.   Let's try 28 cards:  If he keeps 1/3 of 28 cards as his own, that leaves 20 cards to sell.  He gets $30 from selling them ($1.  5 * 20).  This is short of the $50 needed to buy the ticket.  If he had 29 cards, he would get $43.  75 from selling them.   This is still short of the $50 needed to buy the ticket.  If he had 30 cards, he would get $45.   After selling 1/3 of the 30 cards, he would be left with 20 cards and get $45.   He could keep 1/3 of the 30 cards as his own, which is 10 cards.    The remaining 20 cards would make $30. 
[EXP] 63: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Let's start by converting George's spending money to cents.  Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we can convert his $5 as follows: $5 x 100 = 500 cents.  Now, he had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of it, or 0. 99 x 500 = 495.   He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each.  3 x 40 = 120 cents.  Now we subtract the amount spent on chips from the total amount spent:  495 - 120 = 375.    Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, to find out how many candy bars he bought, we divide the amount left over by the cost of one candy bar:  375 ÷ 75 = 5.    The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 64: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Let's find the total number of beads Elizabeth and Margareth have.  Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads, so she has (1 x 20) + (2 x 20) = 20 + 40 = 60 beads.  Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads.  So, she has (3 x 20) + (4 x 20) = 60 + 80 = 140 beads.  Elizabeth has 60 beads, and Margareth has 140 beads.  140 - 60 is 80, so Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 65: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 539, [output]: 17 sneakers were sold at 20 dollars each, so that is 17 x 20 = 340 dollars.  48 - 17 = 31 sneakers remaining.  Those were sold at 25 dollars each.  31 x 25 is 775.  The total amount of money made is 340 + 775 = 1115 dollars.  Since the salesman bought a case of sneakers for 576 dollars, his profit is 1115 - 576 = 539 dollars.  The answer is 539. 
[EXP] 66: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1920, [output]:  First, we need to find the volume (in cubic feet) of the potting soil needed.  Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall, so the volume of each bed is 2 x 8 x 2 = 32 cubic feet.  There are 10 raised beds, so the total volume needed is 10 * 32 = 320 cubic feet.  Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the total number of bags needed is 320 divided by 2.  320 / 2 is 160 bags.  Each bag costs 12 dollars, so the total cost is 160 * 12 = 1920 dollars.  The answer is 1920. 
[EXP] 67: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 71, [output]:  Ali has 21 dollars.  Leila gave him half of her 100 dollars.  Half of 100 is 50.  So Ali now has 21 + 50 = 71.  The answer is 71.

[EXP] 69: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Sarah spent $300 on books, and each book was $15, so the total number of books she bought is 300 / 15 = 20.  Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, so she gave each kid 20 / 4 = 5 books.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 70: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]: 100 is the maximum capacity for both players.  Gabriel has 20 songs and Luri has 3 times that many.  That means Luri has 20 x 3 = 60 songs.  So Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs.  Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs.   So Luri can add 80 - 40 = 40 fewer than Gabriel.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 71: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 8-year-old child has 4 dollars. 12 dollars are needed to buy the toy car. 12 - 4 = 8. 8 dollars still remain.  He will save 2 dollars daily.  How many days will it take to save 8 dollars? 8 / 2 = 4.  The answer is 4 days. 
[EXP] 72: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 112, [output]:  Paul drives twice a day, for 14 days. 14 days * 2 drives per day = 28 drives.  Morning rides cost $6 each, and there are 14 of them, so the morning rides cost $6 * 14 = $84.  Afternoon rides cost $2 each, and there are 14 of them, so the afternoon rides cost $2 * 14 = $28.   In total, Paul spends $84 + $28 = $112.  The answer is $112. 
[EXP] 73: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Suzie bought a total of 4 packs of gum. 2 packs were strawberry, 1 was grape, and 1 was green apple.  The cost of the gum in total was $7.  The cost of the grape gum was $2, and the green apple gum was half as much as the grape gum, so $1.   So that leaves 7 - 2 - 1 = 4 dollars for the 2 packs of strawberry gum.   If you add the cost of the 2 packs of strawberry gum, you get 4, so each pack costs 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 74: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 110, [output]:  Gerald gets paid $30 every day. 7 days in a week, so he earns 30 * 7 = 210 dollars.   He spent a total of $100. 210 - 100 = 110.  The answer is 110. 
[EXP] 75: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]:  Ali has 4 x $10 = $40 and 6 x $20 = $120.  Total money he has is $40 + $120 = $160.  He gives half of the total money to his sister.  Half of $160 is $80.   So he has $160 - $80 = $80 left.   Then he uses 3/5 of $80 to buy dinner.  3/5 of $80 is (3/5) x 80 = 48.   After buying dinner, Ali has $80 - $48 = $32.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 76: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 27 cups of raisins were in the jumbo bag.  Each batch of cookies will take 3/4 cup of raisins.  To find out how many batches she can make, you need to divide the total cups of raisins (27) by the cups of raisins each batch takes (3/4 cup).  So, 27 / (3/4) = 27 * (4/3) = 36.  However, this is how many batches she can make in total.   Since she is dividing the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, she can divide the total number of batches by 3 because there are 3 items being made.  36 divided by 3 is 12.   The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 77: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Jame will be 27 years old in 5 years.  So currently, he is 27 - 5 = 22 years old. 
  His cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age in 8 years.  Twice his age in 8 years is 2 * (22 + 8) = 2 * 30 = 60.  So his cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.   
  Currently, his cousin is 55 - 8 = 47 years old.   
  We find the difference in their ages by subtracting Jame's age from his cousin's age: 47 - 22 = 25.   The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 78: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 35, [output]: 20% of 50 dollars is 0. 20/100 x 50 = 10.  So the total bill with the tip is 50 + 10 = 60.  The wife wants to split the bill, which is 60/2 = 30 dollars per person.   So I end up paying 30 + 10 = 40.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 79: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 130, [output]:  Elise starts by writing the whole alphabet, which is 26 letters. 26 letters were written.  She writes the whole alphabet again, writing another 26 letters.  So, the total number of letters written is 26 + 26 = 52.  She writes half of the alphabet.  Half of 26 is 13. 13 more letters were written.   So, the total number of letters written is 52 + 13 = 65.  She then re-writes everything she has written.  So, she re-writes 65 letters.  65 letters were written again.  65 + 65 = 130.   The answer is 130. 
[EXP] 80: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 92, [output]:  Bill started with 2 cases of water, each with 24 bottles. 2 x 24 = 48 bottles. 48 bottles in total. 70 guests and 2 bottles per guest is a need for 70 x 2 = 140 bottles. 140 - 48 bottles in total already is 92 bottles needed additional.  The answer is 92. 
[EXP] 81: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]: 3 cages have 10 hamsters each, so that's 3 x 10 = 30 hamsters.  3 cages have 5 guinea pigs each, so that's 3 x 5 = 15 guinea pigs.  In total, there are 30 + 15 = 45 rodents.  The answer is 45. 
[EXP] 82: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Initially, Sharon got 5 dollars.  Then for each of the next 3 teeth, she got 1 dollar each.  So she got 3 more dollars.  In total she has 5 + 3 = 8 dollars.  For each of the next 2 teeth, the tooth fairy gave 1/2 of 1 dollar, which is 0. 5 dollars each.  2 x 0. 5 dollars = 1 dollar.  So Sharon got 1 more dollar for the 2 last teeth.   In total she has 8 + 1 = 9 dollars.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 83: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 37, [output]:  The food truck spends $3. 00 a loaf and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  So the cost of the bread for 10 sandwiches is 3. 00.  They spend 30. 00 on different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches, so the total cost is 3. 00 + 30. 00 = 33. 00.   For 10 sandwiches, they sell 10 x 7.  00 = 70.  00.  So their net profit is 70.   00 - 33.  00 = 37.   00.  The answer is 37. 
[EXP] 84: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 215, [output]:  The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes. 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1 hour and 30 minutes is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.  The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes.  2 hours is 120 minutes. 120 + 5 minutes is 125 minutes.  The sum of the length of the two movies is 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.  The answer is 215. 
[EXP] 85: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 52, [output]:  Let's start by calculating Jared's final typing speed:

Original speed: 47 WPM
Increased speed: 52 WPM
Final speed after increasing by 5 words: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM

To find the average of the three measurements, we add them up and divide by 3:

Average = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3
= 156 / 3
= 52 WPM.  The answer is 52 WPM. 
[EXP] 86: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, then let's call his current age "x".  Then, 5 years ago, he was x - 5 years old.  Since he is now twice that age, we have:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.  In 3 years, he will be:

10 + 3 = 13

The answer is 13.

[EXP] 91: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 1st, we find the number of riders who can stay upright.  25% is the same as 25/100, or 1/4.  So, 1/4 of the 100 riders can stay upright.  This is 100 x 1/4 = 25 riders who can stay upright.  Of these, 60% are women.   60% is the same as 60/100, or 3/5.   So, 3/5 of the 25 riders who can stay upright are women.  This is 25 x 3/5 = 15 women.  To find the number of men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:  25 - 15 = 10 men.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 92: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]:  Let's break this problem down.  Paisley ran 4 miles.  Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.  Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.  The answer is 17. 
[EXP] 93: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 29, [output]:  Steve is 60 years old.  His wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.  Their son is half as old as his mom, so their son is 64/2 = 32 years old.  Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.  The answer is 29. 
[EXP] 94: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2100, [output]:  Let the sales of green hats in the first month be x.  Then, we know that the sales of red hats in the first month were 400, which is half the total sales from selling green hats, so x / 2 = 400.  x = 2 * 400 = 800.  
Now, the total amount she made in the first month is 800 + 400 = 1200.  In the second month, 3/4 of this amount was earned, so 3/4 * 1200 = 900 was earned.   The total amount earned in two months is 1200 + 900 = 2100.   The answer is 2100. 
[EXP] 95: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Let's start by finding how long it took to cook beans and then pork and beans. 30 minutes was the time for rice.  20 minutes more for pork means pork took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.  Total cooking time for rice and pork is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes.  The problem states that beans take half of this combined time, so beans took half of 80 minutes, which is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.  Adding up, rice took 30 minutes, pork took 50, and beans took 40, so the total time is 30 + 40 + 50 = 120 minutes.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 96: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 360, [output]: 150 is the total number of teachers.  60% of the teachers are history teachers, and the rest are math teachers.  60% of 150 is 90, so 90 are history teachers and 150 - 90 = 60 are math teachers.  Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours. 60 math teachers each sleep 6 hours, so the total number of hours they sleep is 60 x 6 = 360 hours.  The answer is 360. 
[EXP] 97: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 30 days have passed and 8 days were good in the first 8 days. 8 more days were bad in the next 8 days.  The next 8 days were neutral. 12 good days were counted out of those.   Since there were 12 good days overall, that leaves 12 - 8 = 4 good days left.  After the next three days were 1 good, 1 neutral, and 1 good, 2 good days remained.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 98: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 576, [output]: 6 potatoes makes 36 hash browns.  So for each 6 potatoes, you can make 36 hash browns.  To find the number of hash browns you can make with 96 potatoes, you can divide 96 by 6. 

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So you can make 16 batches of hash browns, and each batch is 36 hash browns.  Therefore, you can make a total of:

16 x 36 = 576

hash browns.  The answer is 576. 
[EXP] 99: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]: 30 cookies were baked by Greta.  Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta, so she bakes 30 x 2 = 60 cookies. 30 + 60 = 90 cookies in total.  After eating 10, there are 90 - 10 = 80 cookies left.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 100: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 68, [output]: 14 red squares, plus 4 more blue squares than red.  That is 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.  Plus 6 more green squares than blue.  That is 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.  Finally, 12 fewer white squares than green.   That is 24 - 12 = 12 white squares. 1 foot by 1 foot is 1 square foot.  The number of square feet in the comforter is the total number of squares.  14 red, 18 blue, 24 green, and 12 white.  So the total number of squares is 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68.  Multiply the number of total squares by 1 square feet to get 68 square feet.  The answer is 68. 
[EXP] 101: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 135, [output]: 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each is 15 x 20 = 300 fireworks.  Only 40% will be visible from Hannah's house, so she will see 0. 4 x 300 = 120 fireworks from the city.  Additionally, she will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard, which is 3 x 5 = 15 more fireworks. 120 + 15 = 135.  The answer is 135. 
[EXP] 102: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 40% of the water is used by the city.  Of that, 80% is industrial.  So 20% is non-industrial.   Since the city uses 40%, the non-industrial portion is 20% of the city's portion.  20% of 40% is 8%.  The answer is 8%. 
[EXP] 103: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 1st, we can find the amount James paid to pick the blueberries: it is 20 + (1. 5 x 30) = 20 + 45 = 65.  Then, the total amount he would have spent if he had bought 30 pounds of blueberries at the store is 30 x 2. 5 = 75.   The amount he saved is 75 - 65 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 104: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2450, [output]: 300 taps per minute with the right foot and 250 taps per minute with the left foot, that is a total of:
300 + 250 = 550
d initializes for each minute she dances with her arms down.  She dances for 3 minutes in this position, so that will be:
550 * 3 = 1650
taps for this position.  When her arms are raised, she taps at a rate of 200 for each foot, which is 200 + 200 = 400 taps for both feet.   She taps her feet in this position for 2 minutes, for a total of:
400 * 2 = 800
taps.   When we add up the total taps for both positions, we get:
1650 + 800 = 2450
taps.  The answer is 2450. 
[EXP] 105: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]: 15 dark blue spools + 45 dark blue spools = 60 blue spools.  Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.  60 / 150 = 0. 4 = 40%.  The answer is 40%. 
[EXP] 106: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 20% of 100 is 20. 50% more than 20 is 20 + 50% of 20 = 20 + 10 = 30.  So candidate B got 30 votes.  The rest of the votes, which are 100 - 20 - 30 = 50, were given to candidate C.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 107: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]: 80 students in total, and each class has the same amount of students.  Let's call the number of students in each class x.  Then, we can represent the total number of students as 2x. 

We know that 40% of the students are girls. 40% is equivalent to 0. 4.  So, 40% of 2x is 0.  4 * 2x.  

Now, let's add the number of girls to the number of boys to get the total number of students.  We get: 0. 4 * 2x + (1 - 0. 4) * 2x = 2x.  This is equivalent to 0.  6 * 2x = 2x.   Therefore, 1.   6 = 1, and 2x = 80.  So, x = 40.   Each class has 40 students and 40% of the students are girls, which is 16 girls.  Therefore, the number of boys in each class is 40 - 16 = 24.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 108: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 3, [output]: 54 students are to be separated into 6 groups.  Each group has 54 / 6 = 9 students.  If the activity requires 12 groups, the students will be in 12 groups.   But they are already in 6 groups.   So they need 12 - 6 = 6 more groups.   The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 109: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]:  There are 33 people on the council.  We can let x be the number of votes against the regulation.  Then, the number of votes in favor of the regulation is 2x. 

  The total number of votes is 33, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

 Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

The number of votes against the regulation is 11.  The number of votes in favor of the regulation is 2 times this, which is 2 x 11 = 22. 

The answer is 22. 
[EXP] 110: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 100, [output]:  To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Let's start by identifying the information we know:

* The three homes will need 250 cases of shingles in total. 
* The first house needs 1/2 of the second house. 
* The third house needs double the first house. 



Let's say the first house needs X cases of shingles.  Then, the second house will need 2X cases of shingles (because the first house needs 1/2 the second).  The third house will need 2X * 2 = 4X cases of shingles (because the third house needs double the first). 

The total number of cases is 250, so we can set up the equation:

X + 2X + 4X = 250

Combine like terms:

7X = 250

Divide by 7:

X = 35

So the first house needs 35 cases of shingles. 

The second house needs 2X = 2*35 = 70 cases of shingles. 

The third house needs 4X = 4*35 = 140 cases of shingles.  The answer is 140. 
[EXP] 111: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 4 vanilla scents were available. 5 of each sold, so 4 x 5 = 20 vanilla scents were sold.  8 fruity scents were available.  2 of each sold, so 8 x 2 = 16 fruity scents were sold.  The difference between 20 vanilla scents and 16 fruity scents is 20 - 16 = 4.  The perfume company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared with the fruity scents.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 112: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4400, [output]: 600 movies are being replaced.  One-third of the movies (1/3 * 600) are part of a series and cost $6 each.  That is 1/3 * 600 = 200 movies.  So Mike has 400 movies left.  40% of the remaining movies are old movies, which are $5 each.   40% * 400 = 0. 4 * 400 = 160 movies.   The price for these movies would be 160 * 5 = 800.  The rest are regular movies for $10.  400 - 160 = 240 movies.   The cost for these would be 240 * 10 = 2400.   The total cost would be the cost of the series (200 * 6 = 1200) plus the cost of the old movies (800) plus the cost of the regular movies (2400), or 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400.   The answer is 4400. 
[EXP] 113: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 1 gallon = 10 miles. 1 gallon costs 3 dollars.  One way between home and office is 5 miles.  So the total distance in a day is 2 * 5 = 10 miles.  For 5 days, it will be 10 * 5 = 50 miles.   Therefore, 50 miles / 10 = 5 gallons of gas per week.   5 gallons at 3 dollars per gallon is 5 * 3 = 15 dollars.  The answer is 15 dollars. 
[EXP] 114: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]: 172 people were originally on the train. 47 people got off, leaving 172 - 47 = 125 people.  Then, 13 people got on, making a total of 125 + 13 = 138 people.  After 38 people got off, there were 138 - 38 = 100 people on the train.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 115: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Billy was originally paid $10 per hour. 2 months later, he was making $10 + $0. 50 = $10. 50 per hour.  After another month, his pay was increased to $10. 50 + $1. 00 = $11.  50 per hour.   Since Sally makes $0. 50 more than Billy's starting salary, she makes $10. 00 per hour.   If they both work 20 hours, Billy will earn 20 x $11. 50 = $230.   Sally will earn 20 x $10.   50 = $200.  Billy will earn 230 - 200 = $30 more. 

The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 116: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1170, [output]:  James paid for a ring.  The ring costs 600 dollars for the diamond and 300 dollars for the gold.  So the total cost of the ring is 600 + 300 = 900.  The premium is 30%. 30% of 900 is (0. 30 * 900) = 270.  So he paid 900 + 270 = 1170 dollars.  The answer is 1170. 
[EXP] 117: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 79, [output]: 1.  Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each, so that's 3 x 5 = 15 petals. 

2.  She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each, so that's 4 x 6 = 24 petals. 15 + 24 is 39.  

3.   Next, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each, so that's 5 x 4 = 20 petals.  39 + 20 is 59.  Nielsen then picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each, so that's 6 x 7 = 42.   59 + 42 is 101.  Since wind blew away one each of the flowers, she loses 7 petals, so we subtract 7 from the total.  101 - 7 is 94.  The answer is 94. 
[EXP] 118: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6,250, [output]:  The charity raised a total of $175,000.  $50,000 comes from organizations and the rest from the students.   So the students raised 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000.  There are 20 students working together, and they raise the same amount.  To find out how much each student raised, we divide the amount they raised (125,000) by the number of students (20).  125,000 / 20 = 6,250.   The answer is 6,250. 
[EXP] 119: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step!

Cindy had 5 green eggs.  She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs. 

She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. 

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs. 

To find the total number of eggs, we add them up: 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27.  The answer is 27. 
[EXP] 120: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Let's start from the bottom.  Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher, so Saskay can lift a mountain 1 * 12 = 12 inches.   Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 12 * 4 = 48 inches.   Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 48 * 10 = 480 inches.  Convert inches to feet: 480 inches = 40 feet.  The answer is 40 feet. 
[EXP] 121: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]: 1/6 of the first glue stick is left, which is 12 * 1/6 = 2 millimeters. 2/3 of the second glue stick is left, which is 12 * 2/3 = 8 millimeters.  1/2 of the third glue stick is left, which is 12 * 1/2 = 6 millimeters. 2 + 8 + 6 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 122: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 975, [output]:  Brenda starts with 300 dollars. 3/4 times that amount is 0. 75 times 300 is 225.  So she earns 225 each year.  After 1 year, she has 300 + 225 = 525 dollars.  After 2 years, she has 525 + 225 = 750.   Finally, after 3 years, she has 750 + 225 = 975.  The answer is 975. 
[EXP] 123: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 144, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

First year, they will build 12 homes. 
Second year, they will build three times this many homes, so 12 * 3 = 36 homes. 
In total, the first two years, they will build 12 + 36 = 48 homes.  Then in the third year, they will double this amount, so 48 * 2 = 96 homes.  
In total, over the next three years, the town will build 12 + 36 + 96 homes. 12 + 36 is 48, and 48 + 96 is 144.  The answer is 144. 
[EXP] 124: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  Since Claire earns 1 badge a month, in a year she will earn 1 x 12 = 12 badges.  Amber will take twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she will earn 1/2 a badge a month, and in a year she will earn 1/2 x 12 = 6 badges.  Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire so in a year she will earn 3 x 12 = 36 badges.   To find how many more Wendy earns compared to Amber, we need to find 36 - 6 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 125: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  First, we need to find out how many jello cups Greg needs.  Greg wants to give each kid 4 jello cups, and there are 30 kids.  So he needs 4 * 30 = 120 jello cups.  Each jello box makes 10 small jello cups, so Greg will need 120 / 10 = 12 boxes of jello.  At $1. 25 per box, he will spend 12 * $1. 25 = $15.  The answer is $15. 
[EXP] 126: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  Paul started with 52 marbles.  His friend gave him 28 marbles, so he now has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.   Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles.  1/4 of 80 is 20, so he lost 20 marbles.  80 - 20 = 60.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 127: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Kelly starts with a budget of $65. 5 packs of bacon for $10 leaves her with $65 - $10 = $55.  Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.  Since a pack of bacon is $2, a packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4, and 6 packets of chicken is $6 * 4 = $24.  Total cost of bacon and chicken so far is $10 + $24 = $34.  The 3 packs of strawberries are $4 each, so they cost 3 * 4 = $12.   The 7 packs of apples are half the price of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $2.   7 packs of apples is 7 * 2 = $14.   Total cost of strawberries and apples is $12 + $14 = $26.  Total cost of all items so far is $34 + $26 = $60.  Kelly has $65 - $60 = $5 left in her budget.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 128: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 5 orchids with 5 petals each means there are 5 * 5 = 25 petals. 4 African daisies with 10 petals each means there are 4 * 10 = 40 petals. 40 - 25 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 129: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 250, [output]:  First, calculate how much he makes in total each month.  For each car rental, he gets paid 3 hours times 25 dollars per hour.  So that is 3 x 25 = 75 dollars.  He rents it out 10 times a month, so he gets 10 x 75 = 750 dollars.  Then subtract his car payment, 750 - 500 = 250.  The answer is 250. 
[EXP] 130: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's first calculate how much material Jo would need to make 4 small masks: 2 yards.  Since she needs to make 20 small masks, we can multiply 2 yards by how many times does she need to make 4 masks.  20 divided by 4 is 5, so the total amount of material for small masks is 5 times 2 yards.   5 x 2 = 10.   For large masks, we need to calculate first how many 2. 25 yards 3 large masks take. 8 large masks will take 8 divided by 3 times 2. 25.    This division will simplify to 4. 25.  Then 4 multiplied by 2. 25 is 10.   Now we simply add up the amount of material for small and large masks: 10 + 10 = 20.   The answer is 20 yards. 
[EXP] 131: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 700, [output]:  Let's start by finding Farmer Smith's farm size.  Since his farm is 100 acres more than twice Farmer Brown's farm, that means his farm is 2 * 200 + 100 acres.  This is equal to 400 + 100 = 500 acres.  Then we add the two farms together: 200 + 500 = 700.  The answer is 700. 
[EXP] 132: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Kira bought 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges.  So she bought in total 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 pieces of fruit.  After Lola ate 2 pieces, there were 14 - 2 = 12 pieces left.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 133: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 4
The sloth takes 4 hours to make one trip.  8 hours means 8/4 = 2 trips.  If he wants to collect 24 berries in total, he needs to collect 24/2 = 12 berries per trip.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let John's age be x.   Paul's age is 10 years older than John, so Paul's age is x + 10.  Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10.  The combined age of Peter, Paul and John is 100, so we can set up the equation (2x + 10) + x + (x + 10) = 100.  Simplifying this equation gives 4x + 20 = 100.   Subtracting 20 from each side gives 4x = 80.   Dividing each side by 4 gives x = 20.  So John's age is 20, Paul's age is 20 + 10 = 30, and Peter's age is 2x + 10 = 2 * 20 + 10 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 135: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  John earns 50 dollars an hour for 6 hours, so he earned 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.  He then spent 50 dollars on gas, so he had 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.  He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he had 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left.   Buying 5 pencils for 10 dollars each is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars spent, leaving him with 150 - 50 = 100 dollars.   He can buy 4 25-dollar pens with 100 dollars.   The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 136: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]:  First, James starts by swimming 60% of the distance. 60% of 20 is 0. 6 x 20 = 12.  So he swims 12 miles at 2 miles per hour.  It takes him 12 / 2 = 6 hours.  Then he rests for half that time.  6 / 2 = 3 hours.  When he gets back in the water, he has to swim the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles.   He now goes half the speed, so 1 mile per hour.   8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.  In total, he takes 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours to get across the lake.  The answer is 17. 
[EXP] 137: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 360, [output]: 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. 


He can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.  To find out how many reports he can staple in an hour, multiply 30 by 4.  30 * 4 = 120.   So he can staple 120 reports in 1 hour.   In 15 hours, he would staple 120 * 15 = 1800 reports.  The answer is 1800. 
[EXP] 138: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Coach brought some balls. 3 boys, Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey, picked them up.  Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason.   Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey.  We know that Jason carried 2 balls.  Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey must have carried half as many as Jason, which is 1 ball.  Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, she must have carried 4 balls.  In total, they carried 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 balls.   Since there are 3 boys, the original number of balls must be 7 x 3 = 21.  The answer is 21. 
[EXP] 139: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]:  Greta started with a batch of one dozen brownies, which is 12. 1/2 dozen more were given to her, which is another 6.  Then she had 4 dozen more, which is 48.  So, she had 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.  Then 1 1/2 dozen were eaten, which is 18. 66 - 18 = 48.   The answer is 48. 
[EXP] 140: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 79, [output]:  Let's figure out how many states India has.  The USA has 50 states, and India has 4 more than half that number.  Half of 50 is 25, and 4 more than that is 25 + 4 = 29.  So India has 29 states.  Now we need to find the total number of states in both countries.  The USA has 50 states, and India has 29 states, for a total of 50 + 29 = 79 states.   The answer is 79. 
[EXP] 141: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]:  Adrianne started with 20 metallic beads from her mother.  Her sister gave her 10 more than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.  Her friend gave her twice as much as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 x 20 = 40 beads.  So in total Adrianne had 20 + 30 + 40 beads.   20 + 30 + 40 is 90 beads.  The answer is 90. 
[EXP] 142: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 30 pounds of soil are available. 10 carnations will require 10 x 1. 5 = 15 pounds, and 4 sunflowers will require 4 x 3 = 12 pounds.  So, 15 + 12 = 27 pounds are used. 30 - 27 = 3 pounds are left for roses.  Since 1 rose requires 1 pound, 3 pounds can plant 3 roses.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 143: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 20 seconds is how long Tobias's howls last.  Chikote's howls last for twice as long, which is 20 * 2 = 40 seconds.  Igneous's howls last for as long as the other two combined.  Tobias's howls are 20 seconds and Chikote's are 40 seconds. 20 + 40 = 60.  Igneous howls for 60 seconds.   Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous's total howls are 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.   There are 60 seconds in a minute.   120/60 = 2.  So the combined length of their howls is 2 minutes.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 144: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Jordan started with a blank slate.  She knew it would take her 20 minutes to make the cake batter, 30 minutes to bake the cake, 2 hours to cool it and 10 minutes to frost it.  Adding it all up, we get 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 180 minutes is equal to 3 hours.  5 pm is 3 hours after 2 pm, so the latest time Jordan can start is 2 pm to serve the cake at 5 pm.  The answer is 2 pm. 
[EXP] 145: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 230, [output]:  First, we need to find the total distance Matteo traveled. 55 miles per hour for 4 hours will be 55 x 4 = 220 miles.  Now we need to find the distance Shandy traveled.  45 miles per hour for 10 hours will be 45 x 10 = 450 miles.  To find how many miles farther Shandy drove, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled.   450 - 220 = 230.  The answer is 230. 
[EXP] 146: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 78, [output]: 15 packs x 60 pieces per pack = 900 pieces total. 900 pieces minus 2 packs that Anne kept = 900 - 120 = 780.  Then, the 780 pieces are shared among Anne's 10 friends. 780 divided by 10 is 78.  The answer is 78. 
[EXP] 147: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Let's start with what we know.  Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.  Let's call the number of large animals x.  Then the number of small animals is 2x.   The price of small animals is 4 dollars.  

Let's call the price of large animals L.  The condition is that the large stuffed animals are sold for three times the price of small ones, so L = 4 * 3 = 12.  The total earnings are 120 dollars.   And we know that the earnings come from both the large and small stuffed animals.   So, 120 is the sum of the earnings from the large and small stuffed animals.  The earnings from large animals are L * x = 12x.  The earnings from small animals are 4 * 2x = 8x.   The total earnings are the sum of these two, so we have 12x + 8x = 120.   Simplify the left side and you have 20x = 120.  20x divided by 20 is x, which is 6.  The number of small animals is 2x, which is 2 * 6 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 148: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]: 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons are originally held by Sally.  40% of 25 red balloons is 25 x 0. 4 = 10.  So 10 red balloons burst and 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons remain.  1/2 of the color yellow balloons burst.   12 / 2 = 6.   So 6 yellow balloons burst and 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons remain.   Sally added 8 blue balloons to her clutch. 75% of 8 blue balloons is 8 * 0. 75 = 6.   So 6 blue balloons are added.   The total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 15 red, 7 green, 6 yellow, and 6 blue balloons.  15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34.  The answer is 34.

In total, 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247 classes visited the Science Center last week.  The answer is 247. 
[EXP] 154: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 251, [output]:  Let's find out the total number of people invited first. 25 classmates + 7 girls in her dance class + 13 family members = 45 people.  Since 4 people said they could not come, that leaves 45 - 4 = 41 people attending the party.  The base fee is $125 for 20 people, so for 41 people it will be $125 + (41 - 20) * 6 = $125 + 21 * 6 = $125 + $126 = $251.  The answer is $251. 
[EXP] 155: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Melanie has saved toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks.  So she has saved 12 x 10 = 120 toothpicks.  She needs 200 toothpicks for the sculpture.  So, 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks left.  To find out how many more weeks it would take to save 80 toothpicks at the same rate, divide 80 by 10: 80 / 10 = 8.  It will take 8 more weeks for her to collect 200 toothpicks.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 156: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]:  Since the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, to find how many inches it grows per year, we can divide 8 by 4.  8 ÷ 4 = 2 inches per year.  

Now, to find how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we can multiply the rate by the number of years.  2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.  The answer is 26. 
[EXP] 157: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1080, [output]: 1.  The triceratops was eaten by half by the Tyrannosaurus rex.  So half is left. 

2.  The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left.  So 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.  That means 1/2 is left after velociraptors. 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4.  The rest is 1 - 3/4 = 1/4.  1/4 is eaten by Allosaurus.  Allosaurus eats 270 kg, so 1/4 of the original amount is 270.  1/4 of x = 270.  Solving for x, we get x = 270 * 4 = 1080.  The answer is 1080.

[EXP] 168: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  First, we must find out how much money Rissa had initially.  Rissa received 3 times as much as Ronnie.  Ronnie had 5 dollars.  So Rissa received 5 x 3 = 15 dollars.   After giving the same amount to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money.  This means that after giving 15/5 = 3 dollars to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of 15.  4/5 of 15 is 12.   So Rissa was given 3 dollars and she had 12 dollars left after the transaction.  This means that Ronnie gave her 3 dollars.   Ronnie started with 5 dollars, and gave 3 dollars.   So Ronnie is left with 5 - 3 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2.

So now he has 2 - 1 + 5 = 6 apples.   He then puts all but 1 in his pocket and throws the remaining 1 at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall.   So he has 6 - 1 + 6 = 11 apples.  And he brings 11 apples home.  The answer is 11. 
[EXP] 171: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 19, [output]:  A nurse station started with some bandages.  On the first day, they used 38 and ordered one bulk pack of 50.  So they have 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.  On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 28 bandages.  After a bulk pack of 50, they have 12 - 28 = -16 bandages.   This does not make sense as they cannot have negative bandages, so we can assume this is a mistake and just calculate the bandages used up till now.   On the third day, they used half a pack of 50, which is 25 bandages and got two bulk packs of 50.   So they used 25 bandages and got 100.  This means they used 100 - 25 = 75 bandages and now have 78 + 75 = 153 bandages.    The problem asks how many bandages they had on the first day, so we subtract 153 from the bandages they have left at the end of the third day.  So 78 - 153 = -75.  This does not make sense as they cannot have negative bandages, so we start back at the first day and calculate.   A nurse station started with some bandages.   On the first day, they used 38 and ordered one bulk pack of 50.   We can call the original bandages x.  x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.   On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 28 bandages.   x + 12 - 28 = x - 16.   On the third day, they used half a pack of 50, which is 25 bandages and got two bulk packs of 50.  So  x - 16 + 25 + 100 = x + 109.    They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so x + 109 - 78 = x + 31.     So x = 78 - 31 = 47.  The answer is 47. 
[EXP] 172: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2400, [output]:  John bought 10 bottles of scotch for 600 dollars.  That is 600 / 10 = 60 dollars per bottle of scotch.  He also bought twice as many bottles of cognac, so he bought 2 * 10 = 20 bottles.  Cognac is 50% more expensive than scotch, so it costs 60 * 1. 5 = 90 dollars per bottle of cognac.  So he spent 20 bottles * 90 dollars per bottle = 1800 dollars on the cognac.  In total, he spent 600 + 1800 = 2400.  The answer is 2400. 
[EXP] 173: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 168, [output]: 20 tourists found 700 shells. 40% of 700 is 0. 4 x 700 = 280.  So team Alphas found 280 shells.  Then, 700 - 280 = 420 shells left. 60% of 420 is 0. 6 x 420 = 252.  So team The finders found 252 shells.  To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we calculate 420 - 252 = 168.  The answer is 168. 
[EXP] 174: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 448, [output]: 14 mL of medicine is the first amount. 3 times that is 14 x 3 = 42 mL.  So in one dosage, they would combine 14 + 42 = 56 mL.  Now to find the total mL for 8 doses, we do 56 x 8 = 448.  The answer is 448. 
[EXP] 175: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 225, [output]:  There are 4 * 10 = 40 students.  Only 8 can try the escape room at a time.  We will have to divide the 40 students into groups of 8.  40 / 8 is 5.  It will take 5 groups to have all 40 students try the escape room.   Since each group takes 45 minutes, the total time it will take is 45 * 5 = 225.  The answer is 225. 
[EXP] 176: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that each person gets 2 treats.  If there are 5 people, in total they get 5 x 2 = 10 treats.  If Carly made both cupcakes and brownies, then 10 must be the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies.  We can use algebra to represent this:

Cupcakes + Brownies = 10

Now, we know that Carly makes 2 less brownies than three times the number of cupcakes.  We can use "C" to represent the number of cupcakes.  Then, three times the number of cupcakes is 3C.  Carly makes 2 less brownies than that, so she makes 3C - 2 brownies.  We can substitute this into our equation:

C + (3C - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4C - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4C = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

C = 3

So Carly made 3 cupcakes.  The answer is 3.

[EXP] 189: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 230, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step: The cost of the new radiator is 400 dollars, but he gets it for 80% off. 80% off means 20% remains.  If 20% is the remaining amount, we can find 20% of 400 by multiplying it by 0. 20/100 * 400 = 80.  So he gets it for 80 dollars.   Then, the mechanic installs it for 3 hours at $50 per hour. 3 * 50 is 150 dollars.   Adding the cost of the radiator and the mechanic's labor, he paid 80 + 150 = 230.  The answer is 230.
